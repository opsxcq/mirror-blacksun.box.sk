ACK - Acknowledged (first, a little about the TCP protocol. When you want to send something from one computer to another using TCP you need to establish a connection first. The sender first sends a packet with the SYN flag on. On this point, the receiver can decide if he wants that packet. If a firewall is blocking the way or there is no daemon on the specific port the packet will be denied and the receiver will reply with a packet with the RST flag on. However, if the receiver wishes to accept the connection, he will reply with both SYN and ACK on, and then the sender should reply with ACK, which means he's ready to send. This whole thing is called a "TCP 3-Way Handshake" and it is good for transferring files which must not be corrupted, since there is no packet loss, and when something goes wrong the receiver can ask the sender to send that packet again. On UDP, you can't make sure the packet will ever get to the receiver but everything goes a lot faster that way. This is why Realplayer (www.real.com) uses UDP. This is why video and audio sometimes gets a little smudged on the way (just a little? Hehe...). But in case you want to transfer applications or games, you cannot afford to lose a single BIT, because if you would the program would probably get corrupted. In such cases, you have to use TCP, which is a bit slower but you don't have to worry about losing important pieces of information. More info at the entry TCP)<br>

It also has blinking lights that make it look really cool. Features: Web-based status display, Configurable warning and panic levels, Notification via Pager or email, Support for grouping of machines, support for modem monitoring, Selectable paging delays, Heterogeneous Network Support. Monitors: dns nntp ftp smtp and pop3 testing, connectivity via ping, http servers up and running, disk space usage, uptime and cpu usage, essential processes are still running, messages and warnings.

If things happen on your system at relatively random and unpredictable times, then some of that randomness will become a part of the entropy pool and can be used to egnerate random numbers. It is basically a user-space implementation of the Linux kernel /dev/random device. As such, it should be runnable on all Unix-like systems. It is intended to make up for the lack of /dev/random on non-Linux systems so that programs like GPG can be used safely. Made by brian Warner)<br>

This is called a gateway. For those who remember the good old BBS days you might remember another type of gateway. Suppose you had a modem which was set to auto answer incoming calls.

You have to answer such brain boggling questions, such as, "What is a BIOS?", "Who wrotethe 'Hacker's Manifesto'?", and "What command do you type to get a directory listing in Linux?"

IP is also the busiest of all the TCP/IP protocols as almost all TCP/IP traffic is encapsulated in IP datagrams. IP's job is to route packets around the network. It provides no mechanism for reliability or accountability, for that, it relies on the upper layers. IP simply sends out datagrams and hopes they make it intact. If they don't, IP can try to send an ICMP error message back to the source, however this packet can get lost as well. IP has no means to guarantee delivery. Since IP is connectionless, it does not maintain any connection state information. Each IP datagram is sent out without regard to the last one or the next one. This, along with the fact that it is trivial to modify the IP stack to allow an arbitarily chosen IP address in the source (and destination) fields make IP easily subvertible)<br>

IPAC - IP Accounting (an IP accounting package for Linux. It collects, summarizes and nicely displays IP accounting data. The output of IPAC can be a simple ASCII table, an ASCII graph or even GIF images with graphs showing traffic progression. IPAC can be used for IP traffic analysis and for accounting purposes.

MID/MIDI - Musical Instrument Digital Interface (a .mid file contains orders for the sound device to create notes. The music is devided into tracks where each track can have the soun of a different musical instrument, and all of the channels are played together. This way you can make channel one play the bass line as a bass guitar, channel two to be an organ, channel three to be an electric guitar, thus making your own music note by note, command by command. General MIDI files contain up to 10 tracks, extended MIDI files up to 16 tracks. Channel 10 is the standard for the beat (drums) channel. The result depends on your sound device. Sound Blaster 16, for example, would produce sounds similar to a PC BEEP (lol) for all instruments, while SOund Blaster AWE64 uses sound samples and the music it produces sounds very realistic. There are also applications that come with their own sound samples. MIDI files can also contain lyrics for programs that can show them, so you could host your own kareoke party!)<br>

TCP - Transfer Control Protocol (TCP is the connection-oriented, reliable transport protocol in the TCP/IP suite.  Connection-oriented simply means that the two hosts participating in a discussion must first establish a connection before data may change hands.  Reliability is provided in a number of means, but the two most important ones are data sequencing and acknowledgement. For acknowledgement, see the entry ACK. Now where were we? Oh, yeah, data sequencing. Since TCP is reliable, it must be able to recover from lost, duplicated, or out-of-order data. By assigning a sequence number to every byte transferred, and requiring an acknowledgement from the other end upon receipt, TCP can guarantee reliable delivery. The receiving end uses the sequence numbers to ensure proper ordering of the data and to eliminate duplicate data bytes. TCP sequence numbers can simply be thought of as 32-bit counters. They range from 0 to 4,294,967,295. Every byte of data exchanged across a TCP connection (along with certain flags) is sequenced. Now, how are sequence numbers set, you ask? Well, once a connection is starting to form (the first packet with the SYN flag on is sent), the sender of the SYN packet will set it's sequence number as an ISN - Initial Sequence Number. The next packet that will be sent will have the sequence number of ISN+1, etc'. The sequence number field in the TCP header will contain the sequence number of the *first* byte of data in the TCP segment. The acknowledgement number field in the TCP header holds the value of next *expected* sequence number, and also acknowledges *all* data up through this ACK number minus one. TCP uses the concept of window advertisement for flow control. It uses a sliding window to tell the other end how much data it can buffer. Since the window size is 16-bits a receiving TCP can advertise up to a maximum of 65535 bytes. Window advertisement can be thought of an advertisement from one TCP to the other of how high acceptable sequence numbers can be. Other TCP header flags of note are RST (reset), PSH (push) and FIN (finish).  If an RST is received, the connection is immediately torn down. RSTs are normally sent when one end receives a segment that just doesn't jive with current connection. The PSH flag tells the receiver to pass all the data is has queued to the aplication, as soon as possible.  The FIN flag is the way an application begins a graceful close of a connection (connection termination is a 4-way process). When one end receives a FIN, it ACKs it, and does not expect to receive any more data (sending is still possible, however))<br>

The main security mechanism in which VVOS is based upon is data partitioning. Data on the system is classified into one of four security classes, or "vaults" - INSIDE, OUTSIDE, SYSTEM and SYSTEM HIGH. The INSIDE vault generally contains the internet front end and any necessary CGI binaries, etc'. SYSTEm and SYSTEM HIGH are responsible for maintaining the external webpages and audit logs respectively. These vaults are totally segregated from each other and work essentially as seperate machines. If a program requires access to either of the vaults it must be authenticated by HP's Trusted Gateway Proxy daemon. The TGP daemon filters all requests from the internet and forwards the to middleware server packages that safely reside behind the INSIDE vault)<br>
