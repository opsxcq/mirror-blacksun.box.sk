How TRACEROUTE works<br><br>

The TRACEROUTE program/application uses ICMP messages and the TTL (Time-To-Live 8-bit) field in the IP<br>
datagram header to determine the path between source and destination host.<br><br>

The value contained in the TTL-field of an IP datagramis processed during handling of the IP datagram by a<br>
router in either of the following two ways:<br><br>

1) if a router holds an IP-datagram for more than one<br>
second, it is supposed to decrement the TTL-field of<br>
that IP datagram by the number of seconds it is held.<br><br>

2) it decrements the TTL-field by one otherwise.<br><br>


Since most routers hold an IP datagram for less than one second the TTL-field effectively counts the number<br>
of routers that it passes through, passing a router is often called a 'hop' and therefore the TTL-field is<br>
sometimes called a 'hop-counter'.<br><br>


The TTL-field enforces that each IP datagram always exists for a finite period of time in the network. In<br>
this period of time, it must either have reached the destination or it is discarded (i.e. the IP datagram<br>
is thrown away) by the network. When a router discards an IP datagram (due to the TTL-field being 0), the<br>
router returns an ICMP "time exceeded" message back to the source host.<br><br>

The TRACEROUTE and TRACERT programs are based on this 'feature'. Consecutive IP datagrams are sent with<br>
increasing values for the TTL-field from 1 upto the value needed to reach the destination host. Under<br>
traceroute (UNIX) the IP packet payload is a UDP packet, normally of a high and destination source port<br>
33000-34000, and under windows the IP packet payload is an ICMP echo request.<br><br>

The trick applied in TRACEROUTE is to use a port number that is highly likely to be unused by any<br>
application at the destination host, usually this number is greater than 30,000. When a packet arrives<br>
at the destination host with an unused port number, the UDP entity will generate an ICMP "port<br>
unreachable" error message. Because we can discriminate between ICMP "time exceeded" error<br>
messages and "port unreachable" error messages at the source host, we know when to halt TRACEROUT.<br><br>

A small example demonstrating each phase in the operation of TRACEROUTE is given in the next figure.<br><br>

note: see Modem Speedup section at blacksun.jemix.com), and it is used to test 
your connection to the host and to test the speed of the connection. You can 
also use the ping message (which the target IP must to reply to this massage) to 
nuke another computer, if you have it's IP (you can get your target's IP in 
several different ways. One of the most common ways is through ICQ or IRC). It 
can also it is used to trace-route and to check the stability of the 
network.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT

<BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>The rest of the

<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Wingate is a proxy 
software package for windowze it allows you to share a dialup account across a 
local area network (LAN) It's pretty easy to set up, but is reportedly full of

size=-1>Well, KRom's answer was pretty good, but he missed a few important 
details.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>You see, Wingate is a proxy software for Windows 95/98, as he described, 
but it contains many many many holes so you can use it to relay your data so 
it'll look like the "Wingated" computer is sending it, not you.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>How to find 
Wingates: almost every lame "hacking" page has wingates scanners on it. These

with Wingates:</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>Telnet to port 1080 on the "Wingated" machine. Once you get in, you will 
probably see a blinking text cursor. Don't worry, you're in. Now simply type 
'ip-address port' (without the quotes) and the Wingated machine will send you 
the results.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>For example: typing 'hackernews.com 80' will connect you to port 80 on 
hackernews.com, which is the webserver port. This means a web daemon will 
answer, and you'll need to send in some webserver commands (the same thing your 
browser does when you point it to hackernews.com).</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>You can also use Wingates to 
easily spoof your IP on IRC. Simply start your IRC client, find a place where it 
says something about firewalls and then tell it that you're using a SOCKS4 proxy 
(no, SOCKS doesn't have anything to do with socks. It's just an abbreviation for 
sockets, I think. Nevermind, you don't wanna know). When you are asked to insert 
the IP of the firewall, enter the IP of the wingated machine 
instead.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT

http://www.cyberarmy.com/lists/wingate/. They exist out of contributions, and

<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Brief history: Back 
in the early sixties, during the development of third generation computers at 
MIT, a group of programmers studying the potential of computers, discovered 
their ability of performing two or more tasks simultaneously. Bell Labs, taking 
notice of this discovery, provided funds for their developmental scientists 
to&nbsp; investigate into this new frontier. After about 2 years of 
developmental research, they produced an operating system they called 
"Unix".</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>Sixties to Current: During this time Bell Systems installed the Unix 
system to provide their computer operators with the ability to multitask so that 
they could become more productive, and efficient. One of the systems they put on 
the Unix system was called "Elmos". Through Elmos many tasks (i.e. billing, and 
installation records) could be done by many people using the same 
mainframe.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>Current: Today, with the development of micro computers, such 
multitasking can be achieved by a scaled down version of Unix (but just as 
powerful). Microsoft, seeing this development, opted to develop their own Unix 
like system for the IBM line of PC/XT's. Their result they called Xenix 
(pronounced zee-nicks). Both Unix and Xenix can be easily installed on IBM PC's 
and offer the same functions (just 2 different vendors).</FONT></FONT>

size=-1>The first password is the BIOS password, a relatively easy thing to 
remove. First you have to open up the computer and find the round quarter sized 
lithium battery (most computers have them). On some machines like a Compaq for 
example you are required to also reset a jumper and remove the battery. The 
jumper will be marked "reset CMOS". In most cases all you have to do is pop off 
the lithium battery and wait a good 15-30 seconds for the memory to be erased 
from the BIOS. Once this is done put the battery back, put the cover back on the 
computer and start it up. Most likely there will be an alert that the Bios was 
reset and most new motherboards will detect all of devices over again, so it's 
no biggie. Here comes Windoze... it's loading... loading... (COME ON!!!)

quotes) "ren c:\Windows\*.pwl *.pwk" so windows can't see the password files. If 
he set a password to the BIOS menu, open his computer.&nbsp; Look on the

normally need to short a jumper on the motherboard. Most motherboards actually 
label the correct jumper, making your job easier. In most motherboards the 
jumper must be shorted while the computer is on. However, a small percentage of 
boards will be damaged if you try this. For that reason, try shorting the jumper 
with the computer off first, removing the jumper and turning the computer on. If 
that fails, then turn the computer on with the jumper in place. If you can't 
find the jumper, or it doesn't exist, unplug the computer. Find the internal 
battery and remove it. Most computers will clear CMOS anywhere between 10 
seconds and 24 hours without any power.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT

needn't give up quite yet. On some computers, flooding the keyboard buffer will 
crash the password routine and allow the computer to boot. Simply wait for the 
password prompt, then press ESC repeatedly. This may require 50 to 100 presses, 
and may not work in all machines, but its worked before, and its worth a try. If 
you have that nagging Bios password on any Award BIOS, there is a default
