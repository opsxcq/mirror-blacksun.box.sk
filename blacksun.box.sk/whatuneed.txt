 Well this is my second text-file, i hope you've enjoyed
 my last text-file. This one is aimed at beginners who are
 interested into spoofing, hijacking and sequence number 
 attacks. Most of the beginners who have read those text-files 
 don't know what kind of programs/tools/scripts they need to
 do those specified attacks written in those text-files. But 
 it is very true, i've read most of the TCP/IP-security 
 documents out there, and none of them tells you what you 
 need, to execute the specified attacks. (Well at least not 
 in an easy way, like where to obtain those specified tools).
 So that's one of the main reasons why i attempted to write
 this text-file.

 It is actually pretty simple, to execute all of the attacks
 mentioned in those text-files you'll simply need 4 things :
 
 *NOTE* : All the tools i've mentioned are provided with urls   
          at the end of this text, i guess that's easier for 
          you to obtain the tools i've mentioned.

 1. Some sorta Unix or Unix-based OS (Operating System). 
    Linux for example would work fine if you plan to do 
    some serious TCP/IP Internetworking-related stuff. 
    Because you really can't do some good attacks with 
    any MS-based products, but hey IT IS possible, but still, 
    what i'm referring in this text-file are attacks executed 
    in Linux.

 2. Packet Generator (like Spak, Libnet, etc.)
    (Generates and sends packets which you specify, 
    this includes flags, sequence numbers, window size
    and everything else you usually see in a packet.) 
 
 3. Packet Sniffer   (like Sniffit, Ipgrab, etc.)
    *NOTE* : You'll need a sniffer which allows you to read
             the header of a specific packet (which includes
             flags, sequence numbers, window size, source and
             destination ports etc.)
 
 4. Usually a trusted host,a target host and attacking host 
    (that's you, most of the hackers/crackers out there uses 
    compromised hosts.)
   
   *NOTE*: #4 was actually meant for the real newbies :-)
           

   That's about everything you will need to do those attacks.
   Now lets go on about WHERE to obtain those tools mentioned above:

Comment added my R a v e N from http://blacksun.box.sk (okay, okay, so I'm
promoting my website... you got me.  :-)):
For newbies, I'd recommend 'IP Spoofing Demystified'. You can get it from the
books/texts page at blacksun.box.sk.
    Happy spoofing!
