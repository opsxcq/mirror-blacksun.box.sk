INTRODUCTION

This document is the third volume in the series of companion documents to the Trusted Database 
Management System Interpretation of the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria [TDI 91; 
DoD 85]. This document examines polyinstantiation issues in multilevel secure (MLS) database 
management systems and summarizes the research to date in this area.

1.1	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE

In 1991 the National Computer Security Center published the Trusted Database Management 
System Interpretation (TDI) of the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC). The 
TDI, however, does not address many topics that are important to the design and development of 
secure database management systems (DBMSs). These topics (such as inference, aggregation, and 
database integrity) are being addressed by ongoing research and development. Since specific 
techniques in these topic areas had not yet gained broad acceptance, the topics were considered 
inappropriate for inclusion in the TDI.

The TDI is being supplemented by a series of companion documents to address these issues 
specific to secure DBMSs. Each companion document focuses on one topic by describing the 
problem, discussing the issues, and summarizing the research that has been done to date. The intent 
of the series is to make it clear to DBMS vendors, system designers, evaluators, and researchers 
what the issues are, the current approaches, their pros and cons, how they relate to a TCSEC/TDI 
evaluation, and what specific areas require additional research. Although some guidance may be 
presented, nothing contained within these documents should be interpreted as criteria.

These documents assume the reader understands basic DBMS concepts and relational database 
terminology. A background in security sufficient to use the TDI and TCSEC is also assumed; 
however, fundamentals are discussed whenever a common understanding is important to the 
discussion.

1.2	SCOPE

This document addresses polyinstantiation issues in multilevel secure DBMSs. It is the third of five 
volumes in the series of TDI companion documents, which includes the following documents:

·	Inference and Aggregation Issues in Secure Database Management Systems [Inference 
96]

·	Entity and Referential Integrity Issues in Multilevel Secure Database Management 
Systems [Entity 96]

·	Polyinstantiation Issues in Multilevel Secure Database Management Systems

·	Auditing Issues in Secure Database Management Systems [Audit 96]

·	Discretionary Access Control Issues in High Assurance Secure Database Management 
Systems [DAC 96]

This series of documents uses terminology from the relational model to provide a common basis 
for understanding the concepts presented. For most of the topics covered in this series, the concepts 
presented should apply to most database modeling paradigms, depending on the specifics of each 
model. This document specifically addresses relational DBMSs.

This document is related to the documents Inference and Aggregation Issues in Secure Database 
Management Systems [Inference 96] and Entity and Referential Integrity Issues in Multilevel 
Secure Database Management Systems [Entity 96]. Much of the discussion of the relationship 
between enforcement of integrity constraints and multilevel security centers on the inference 
channels which integrity constraints can introduce. In most cases, the enforcement of any integrity 
constraint referring to multilevel data will create a signaling channel [Meadows 88]. One way to 
avoid these channels caused by enforcing entity integrity is to use polyinstantiation.

1.3	INTRODUCTION TO POLYNISTANTIATION

The goal of mandatory security is to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of data by prohibiting 
users (or automated programs working on behalf of users) from accessing data for which they are 
not cleared. MLS DBMSs utilize mandatory access controls (MAC) based on the access class of 
the subject that is acting on behalf of (or in the name of) some named, accountable user. However, 
low-level users may be able to infer high-level information from only low-level data, real world 
knowledge of what the database is modeling, and knowledge of how the database functions. 
Besides preventing direct access to high data values, the TCB must also inhibit users from drawing 
inferences from the perceived existence (or absence) of high data, or from any noticeable effects 
from the manipulation of this data. This section introduces these concepts, which are examined in 
greater detail in later sections of this document.

Suppose that a multilevel database relation with element level labeling is constructed to summarize 
potentially sensitive flight mission information, as depicted in Figure 1.1. This relation's schema 
specifies a primary key of Flight ID and three attributes that describe the Origin, Destination, and 
Cargo of each flight. Associated with each element is a security label. Flight personnel on the 
ground, who are cleared to Secret, may need to be privy to Flight ID and Origin/Destination 
information. However, it may be desired that the nature of the flight manifest be at times hidden to 
all but Top Secret users. For example, Flight 007's cargo of alien spacecraft debris may be 
considered Top Secret. However, ground personnel may learn weight and size specifics, and may 
even be witness to the real-world loading process. The absence of data in the Cargo field would 
increase the likelihood of low users correctly inferring the presence of a Top Secret cargo with 
resulting natural curiosity as to its nature. It is possible that such an inference would threaten the 
success of the mission. Instead, a "cover story" could intentionally be created so that low users are 
placated by the plausible, but erroneous statement that the cargo consists of weather balloon debris. 
The question then becomes how to store and manage this conflicting information in the database.

Figure 1.1: Introduction to Polyinstantiation

A broader issue than cover stories that arises with a multilevel database is how the DBMS should 
address attempts by subjects to insert or change multilevel database objects. A low-level user may 
attempt to modify a tuple that, unbeknownst to him, already contains high data. If the database 
were to permit this, the low-level user would be able to change data of which that user is not even 
aware. This is likely to be undesirable. If instead, the database were to notify the user of the 
collision, the user would be able to infer that high data exists, and a downward signaling channel 
would result.

In a like manner, if a high user attempts to insert data in a field which already contains low data, 
there are a similar set of inadequate approaches. The database can permit the update, but this would 
violate confidentiality with a direct write down from a high subject. The database can prohibit the 
subject from making the update, but it would be impractical to always disallow updates by high 
users. Finally, the database can perform the update, but automatically raise the classification of the 
data to the higher level of the update. However, since this would effectively make this field 
disappear from the low-level user's perspective, a downward signaling channel would again be 
created.

In order to avoid the drawbacks of these update approaches, an alternative is for the database to 
support multiple instances of records with the same primary key at different levels. 
Polyinstantiation is a solution that controls inference and signaling channels, and that also offers a 
way to implement cover stories. Polyinstantiation permits the creation of multiple instances of data 
records -- a low user sees the tuple associated with a particular primary key populated with one set 
of element values; a high user may see the "same" tuple with perhaps different values for some of 
the elements or multiple tuples of different levels with different data values. By supporting 
multiple instances, the database could allow a low subject to insert data and not change the data in 
the existing higher level record. Likewise, a high subject is permitted to insert data without 
disclosing it to low subjects

Polyinstantiation expands the notion of primary key to include the security label so that more than 
one tuple may possess the same "apparent primary key" if they are at different security levels. By 
its nature, polyinstantiation thus necessitates the violation of integrity across levels: Users at 
different security levels querying on a record with the same apparent primary key will not be 
ensured of viewing the same data. The DBMS ensures database integrity only with respect to the 
data at a given level. Integrity across levels cannot be enforced if multilevel confidentiality is 
strictly enforced.

The impetus for supporting polyinstantiation is the attempt to reconcile conflicting requirements 
within an MLS DBMS -- the fundamental conflict between data integrity (which is not required by 
the TCSEC) and confidentiality (which is required by the TCSEC). Confidentiality, or secrecy, 
refers to protecting the data from unauthorized disclosure, while integrity refers to protecting the 
data from unauthorized alteration or destruction.

It is important to note that the TDI does not explicitly mandate that polyinstantiation be supported 
(or implemented). It only requires that confidentiality be enforced correctly, and that an evaluated 
DBMS address in some manner the threat to confidentiality that can arise from integrity constraints 
defined over data at more than one security level. Enforcing integrity constraints can open channels 
by which high-level information can be transmitted down to low-level users, either through some 
form of signaling, or through inference. Signaling channels can covertly transfer information 
through permitting either detectable changes to a low-level storage object to reflect high-level data 
(storage channel), or timing variations, detectable at the low-level which reflect the encoding of 
high-level data (timing channel). Guidelines on acceptable bandwidths for covert channels are 
given in Section 8 of the TCSEC. The potential speed of signaling makes attention to these 
channels important for even TCSEC Class B1 DBMS products to address as an unacceptable 
design flaw. Inference channels permit low-level users to infer high-level information from only 
low-level data and knowledge about the real world and how the DBMS works. Polyinstantiation is 
an approach to enforcing confidentiality while retaining some data integrity. In the wider database 
community, integrity refers more generally to the correctness, accuracy, and internal consistency 
of data. The issue becomes one of stretching the traditional non-secure data model, with its built-
in data integrity safeguards, to accommodate the needs of the MLS environment.

The topic of polyinstantiation remains contentious because it introduces additional complexity into 
a database and it increases confusion as to what in a database reflects correctly modeled real-world 
values. For example, a polyinstantiated real-world entity may be modeled by multiple database 
tuples, and cases can easily arise where no single one of these tuples will contain all the correct 
element values to properly describe the real-world entity. Further, the relational theory of 
normalization is at odds with polyinstantiation enforcement: for example, a relation with 
polyinstantiated elements is not even in first normal form. This document reviews polyinstantiation 
research, examines these concerns, and summarizes different approaches to address the underlying 
database integrity-secrecy conflict.

1.4	AUDIENCES OF THIS DOCUMENT

This document is targeted at four primary audiences: the security research community, database 
application developers/system integrators, trusted product vendors, and product evaluators. In 
general, this document is intended to present a basis for understanding the necessity for supporting 
polyinstantiation or a suitable alternative in MLS DBMSs. Implemented approaches and ongoing 
research are examined. Members of the specific audiences should expect to get the following from 
this document:

Researcher

This document describes the basic issues associated with polyinstantiation. Important research 
contributions are discussed as various topics are examined. By presenting current theory and 
debate, this discussion will help the research community understand the scope of the issue and 
highlight polyinstantiation approaches and alternatives. For additional relevant work, the 
researcher should consult two associated TDI companion documents: Inference and Aggregation 
Issues in Secure Database Management Systems [Inference 96] and Entity and Referential 
Integrity Issues in Multilevel Secure Database Management Systems [Entity 96].

Database Application Developer/System Integrator

This document highlights the potential hazards and added complexity of management caused by 
polyinstantiation in MLS applications. It describes techniques to aid the application developer to 
minimize the occurrence of polyinstantiation and facilitate the efficient locating and cleanup of 
undesired polyinstantiation aftereffects. Intentional polyinstantiation in the form of cover stories is 
introduced, and the issues associated with cover story support are examined.

Trusted Product Vendor

This document describes the conflict between integrity and secrecy. It examines approaches to 
polyinstantiation enforcement in an MLS database and the benefits and drawbacks of these 
approaches. This is discussed in the context of tuple level as well as element level labeling. 
Approaches to polyinstantiation adopted by currently evaluated commercial MLS DBMS products 
are examined. 

Evaluator

This document presents an understanding of polyinstantiation issues to facilitate evaluation of a 
candidate MLS DBMSs implementation of polyinstantiation or an alternative.

The organization of the remainder of this document is as follows:

·	Section 2 provides background by defining terminology and notation adopted by this 
document, and by introducing concepts basic to the discussion of polyinstantiation.

·	Section 3 describes the issues associated with polyinstantiation in more detail and 
discusses the architectural considerations that affect polyinstantiation.

SECTION 2

BACKGROUND

This section provides background necessary for discussing polyinstantiation. Terminology and 
notation used by this report are introduced in Section 2.1. Section 2.2 compares polyinstantiation 
enforced at the granularity of a tuple versus at the granularity of an element. Section 2.3 compares 
the triggering of polyinstantiation due to an action on the part of a user at the high level versus by 
one at the low level.

2.1	TERMINOLOGY AND NOTATION

MLS DBMSs utilize MAC to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of high-level data to low-level 
users. In an MLS DBMS, it is necessary to hide the actions (inserts, deletes, updates) of high 
subjects from low subjects, and thereby prevent signaling channels that could disclose high-level 
data. It is also important to prevent low-level user actions from overwriting high-level data in the 
DBMS. Inference is another threat to MAC policy: low-level users may be able to infer high-level 
information from only low-level data, real world knowledge, and knowledge about how the DBMS 
works, such as what actions it normally allows or disallows. One method to reduce or eliminate 
some potential inference channels is to upgrade the classification of some key data element in the 
inferential chain and thus remove access to it by the low-level user [Inference 96]. However, other 
inferential chains to the high-level information may be available using an alternate path or too 
much information may have already been disseminated and thus no longer be explicitly 
represented in (controlled by) the database [Garvey 91]. Polyinstantiation (and support for cover 
stories) addresses these concerns.

The term polyinstantiation was coined by the Secure Data Views (SeaView) project and refers to 
the simultaneous existence within an MLS DBMS of multiple data objects with the same name, 
where the multiple instantiations are distinguished by their security level [Denning 87]. The 
relational data model is the formalism used in describing polyinstantiation. We assume readers 
possess basic familiarity with the relational data model [Date 81, 83]. To illustrate the notation we 
use throughout this paper, we give some brief definitions pertinent to MLS DBMSs and discussion 
of polyinstantiation approaches.

A standard relational database can be perceived by its users as a collection of relations. Relations 
are composed of tuples. A tuple (v1, v2, ..., vk) has k components where the i-th component is vi. 
A relation may be viewed as a table, with rows called tuples, and the columns called attributes. A 
relation has well-defined mathematical properties and consists of a relation scheme (which defines 
the attributes and name of the relation) and a relation instance. A relation schema R (A1, ..., An) 
consists of a relation name R and a set of attribute names A1, ..., An. An instance R of the schema 
R consists of a set of tuples t, each of which contains a single value t[Ai] for each attribute Ai.

In an MLS environment, relations may consist of values at different classification levels. These 
classification levels are ordered according to a security lattice. The reader should be familiar with 
classification levels and the standard models of secure information flow [Fernandez 81, Denning 
82]. Our examples will refer to the levels Top Secret (TS), Secret (S), Confidential (C), and 
Unclassified (U) as applied to both data and to user sessions. For example, an "S-user" is a user 
performing actions on the database from a session operating at the Secret level.

A multilevel relation schema Rc is an augmented version of a relation schema R (A1,...,An in which 
security labels are associated with certain attributes, as constrained in the multilevel schema. These 
are maintained by the DBMS TCB for each tuple. In a system that requires all values in a single 
tuple to be uniformly classified, Rc may simply have a security label, TC, which is associated with 
each tuple. If values within a tuple may be classified at different levels, then Rc includes security 
labels C1,...,Cn, associated with each one of the attributes A1,...,An, respectively, within a tuple. (If 
it is known that certain attributes will always be classified at the same level within a single tuple, 
fewer security labels may be stored.) The inclusion of security labels C1,...,Cn represents the most 
general case and is therefore used in this document.

The basic model for multilevel relations needs to be defined with a MAC policy in mind. The MAC 
policy for MLS databases is often based on the Bell-LaPadula model [Bell 76], which is stated in 
terms of subjects and objects. A subject is an active entity, such as a process that can request access 
to objects, whereas an object is a passive entity, such as a record, a file, or a field within a record. 
Every subject is assigned a clearance level and every object a classification level. Classification 
levels and clearances are collectively referred to as security levels, and form a lattice. Each security 
level has two components: a hierarchical component and a set (possibly empty) of unordered 
categories. A security level c1 is said to dominate security level c2, in the induced partial order, if 
(1) the hierarchical component of c1 is greater than or equal to that of c2, and (2) all categories in 
c2 are included in those of c1. A security level c1 strictly dominates security level c2, in the partial 
order, if (1) c1 dominates c2, and (2) c1 does not equal c2.

The following are two necessary conditions in the Bell-LaPadula model [Bell 76, DoD 85]:

1.	The Simple Security Property or "No Read Up": A subject can only read objects at a 
security level dominated by the subject's level, and

2.	The *-Property (Star Property) or "No Write Down": A subject can only write objects at 
a security level that dominates the subject's level.

To apply these concepts to a DBMS, it is necessary to determine the granularity of the objects 
protected by MAC, i.e., the storage objects. Security levels are then associated with these storage 
objects. Work on MLS databases has focused on four choices for assigning security levels to data 
stored in a relation. One can assign security levels to entire relations, to individual tuples (rows) of 
a relation, to individual attributes (columns) of a relation, or to individual elements of a relation. 
Much of the research on polyinstantiation has examined the case where security levels are assigned 
to individual data elements stored in relations. However, since tuple level labeling is used in all 
MLS DBMS products evaluated to date, the concept of polyinstantiation must also be considered 
in the (simplified) context of tuple level labeling. Polyinstantiation is not an issue when all values 
of a given attribute are uniformly classified as is the case with relation level or attribute level 
labeling [Hinke 75].

A candidate key of a relation schema is a minimal set of attributes that uniquely determine the other 
attributes. There may be a number of candidate keys for a relation schema R, i.e., there may be 
distinct sets of attributes that could be chosen to be a key for the relation. One candidate key is 
identified as the primary key. The notion of a primary key is a fundamental concept in the world 
of single-level relational databases. The primary key is used to facilitate storage and retrieval, and 
maintain the integrity of relations. Entity integrity requires that the primary key serve as a unique 
identifier of each tuple in the relation and that it does not contain a null value.

While the notion of a primary key is simple and well understood for classical (single-level) 
relations, it does not have a straightforward extension to multilevel relations. A primary key's 
uniqueness requirement can create signaling channels [Meadows 88]. One approach to avoiding 
these channels involves augmenting the user-defined primary key with security labels associated 
with the primary key attributes. The concept of an apparent primary key was introduced by 
Denning et al., to refer to the unaugmented user-defined primary key [Denning 87].

A multilevel relation is said to be polyinstantiated when it contains two or more tuples with the 
same apparent primary key values. Therefore, the real primary key (i.e., the minimal set of 
attributes unique in each tuple) of the multilevel relation is obtained by additionally considering 
the security labels associated with the attributes of the apparent primary key. The exact manner in 
which this is done is closely related to the precise polyinstantiation behavior of the relation 
[Cuppens 92]. The discussion of different approaches to resolving the polyinstantiation problem 
provided in Sections 4 and 5 includes descriptions of how real primary keys are defined.

2.2	TUPLE VERSUS ELEMENT POLYINSTANTIATION

Two types of polyinstantiation may be considered. Tuple polyinstantiation refers to 
polyinstantiation at the granularity of the data tuple (which normally represents a realworld entity). 
Element polyinstantiation refers to polyinstantiation at the granularity of a data element.

A relation with tuple polyinstantiation contains multiple tuples with the same apparent primary key 
values, but with different access class values. As an example, consider the relation Starship-
Objective-Destination (SOD) illustrated in Figure 2.1. The named "starship" is tasked with 
performing a particular mission objective at a specified destination in the galaxy. In this relation, 
it may be considered important to the success of a mission that a particular objective or destination 
not be accessible to users not cleared up to a certain security level. It may even be desired that the 
existence of the craft itself remain secret to uncleared users.

Figure 2.1: A Multilevel Relation With Tuple Polyinstantiation

Here we demonstrate the SOD relation using an element-level labeling database in which each 
element has a classification as well as a value. In an element-level labeling database, the 
classification of a tuple is computed to be the least upper bound of the classifications of the 
individual data elements in the tuple. This computed value is denoted in our examples within a 
bolded column to distinguish it from data which must be stored in the database. The attribute 
Starship is the apparent primary key of SOD. This example and many of those following are drawn 
from Jajodia et al. [Jajodia 94].

The relation given in Figure 2.1 contains two tuples for a starship that has the same name, resulting 
in tuple polyinstantiation. The apparent primary key values are identical in both tuples; however, 
these values have different classification levels. These tuples can be regarded as pertaining to two 
different real-world entities (e.g., if the existence of the secret Enterprise starship is unknown to a 
U-user who then independently chooses to christen an unclassified starship "Enterprise"). It can 
also be regarded as pertaining to two representations of a single real-world entity (e.g., an 
unclassified cover story for a secret mission). It is important to note that the relation itself does not 
indicate which of these two interpretations is true.

Figure 2.2 shows a relation with element polyinstantiation. A relation with element 
polyinstantiation contains two or more tuples with identical values both for the apparent primary 
key and the associated classification level element, but these tuples have different values for one 
or more other elements, as illustrated in Figure 2.2. Both tuples in this relation refer to the same 
starship Enterprise; however, the objectives and destinations of these tuples appear different to 
users at the Secret level.

Figure 2.2: Multilevel Relation With Element Polyinstantiation

As mentioned before, even when multilevel relations are labeled by tuple instead of element, 
explicit polyinstantiation is still possible. Consider the same relation as in Figure 2.1 with the tuple-
level labeling that is offered by all currently evaluated commercial MLS DBMS products. The S-
user will see the multilevel relation shown in Figure 2.3. In this case the TC column is not bolded. 
Because there are no security labels associated with individual elements, the classification of the 
tuple must be stored explicitly (or implicitly) in the DBMS.

Figure 2.3: Polyinstantiated Multilevel Relation With Tuple-Level Labeling

Notice that when tuple-level labeling is used, there is no differentiation between tuple 
polyinstantiation and element polyinstantiation. In the example above, both tuples may possibly 
pertain to a single starship. In this case, the U-tuple may be a cover story which was purposely 
inserted to appease low user curiosity, or it may represent data about the starship which was entered 
by a low user (whether erroneously or from another Unclassified source such as a news feed) or it 
may have been left unchanged when an update was performed by a high user. On the other hand, 
it is also possible that the tuples refer to two different starships that happen to have the same name, 
although this situation may have arisen by error.

2.3	POLYHIGH VERSUS POLYLOW POLYINSTANTIATION

Tuple and element polyinstantiation can be triggered in two different ways: these are called 
polyhigh and polylow for mnemonic convenience.

1.	Polyhigh occurs when a subject at a high level attempts to insert a tuple with the same 
apparent primary key as a low tuple or attempts to modify a low tuple. Although the high 
subject could be notified of this collision, the low-level data cannot be modified. 
Modifying the data and permitting access to it at the lower level would result in a direct 
write down in violation of the MAC policy. Modifying the data and raising its level to 
match the higher level of the subject would create a downward signaling channel, as the 
data would disappear at the low level. Polyhigh polyinstantiation leaves the old tuple 
unmodified, and instead inserts a new tuple which contains the new higher level data.

2.	Polylow occurs when a subject at a low level attempts to insert a tuple with the same 
apparent primary key as a high tuple or modify an attribute of a tuple which already 
contains high data. In this case the low subject cannot be notified of the collision: if the 
update were rejected, there would be a downward signaling channel. Therefore, a new 
tuple is added with the lower level data.

The following examples show polyhigh and polylow using element polyinstantiation; tuple 
polyinstantiation is similar.

To illustrate polyhigh, suppose that a subject attempts to update the following relation:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise        U

Exploration        U

null                  U

U

Suppose that the following sequence of updates occurs.

1.	A U-user updates the destination of the Enterprise to be Talos. The result of this update is:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise        U

Exploration        U

Talos                U

U

2.	Next, an S-user wishes to update the destination of the Enterprise to be Rigel. The system 
cannot reject this update without denying legitimate privileges to the user, but there would 
be a downward signaling channel if the U-level data were replaced by S-level data because 
U-users would see data disappearing, as a result of the data being upgraded. Therefore, a 
new tuple is added, making the relation polyinstantiated. U-users would see the following 
unchanged relation:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise        U

Exploration        U

Talos                U

U

S-users, however, could see the following modified relation:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise        U

Exploration        U

Talos              U

U

Enterprise        U

Spying               U

Rigel               S

S

S-users may interpret this polyinstantiated relation in two ways: (1) the tuples represent a real-
world truth, namely that the U-Level destination is a cover story for the S-level destination, or (2) 
that there is some error or inconsistency in the database that must be repaired.

To illustrate polylow, suppose that the two updates above occur in the opposite order. Starting from 
the same initial relation as above, suppose the updates occur in the following sequence.

1.	An S-user updates the destination of the Enterprise to be Rigel. U-users see the following 
unchanged relation:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise        U

Exploration        U

null                  U

U

S-users, however, see the following modified relation:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise        U

Exploration        U

Rigel                 S

S

2.	A U-user wishes to update the destination of the Enterprise to be Talos. The system cannot 
reject this update or even notify the U-user without causing a downward signaling channel, 
so the U-tuple is modified. U-users see the following modified relation:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise        U

Exploration        U

Talos                 U

U

S-users see the following polyinstantiated relation, identical to the one at the end of the 
polyhigh example:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise        U

Exploration        U

Talos              U

U

Enterprise        U

Spying               U

Rigel               S

S

In some applications, permitting the denial of service (in the case of polyhigh) or the overwriting 
of high data with low data (in the case of polylow), may be tolerable. Generally, however, 
polyinstantiation is required to enforce a multilevel security policy which prevents signaling 
channels as well as denial of service. Polyinstantiation may introduce complexity and even 
ambiguity into a database. These and other issues associated with polyinstantiation are examined 
in the following section.

SECTION 3

POLYINSTANTIATION CONSIDERATIONS

This section summarizes issues associated with polyinstantiation. Section 3.1 examines particular 
problems that polyinstantiation introduces. Section 3.2 presents a straightforward but flawed 
alternative to polyinstantiation. Section 3.3 examines the issue of enforcing automatic 
polyinstantiation versus user requested polyinstantiation. Limiting polyinstantiation to occur only 
when an authorized user explicitly requests it (i.e., to enforce cover stories) simplifies enforcement, 
eliminating many of the problems associated with polyinstantiation. Section 3.4 examines the 
architectural implications of supporting polyinstantiation.

3.1	PROBLEMS CAUSED BY POLYINSTANTIATION

This section discusses problems that enforcement of polyinstantiation presents to the database 
designer and maintainer, as well as the database application designer and database user. A core 
problem associated with polyinstantiation is the fundamental conflict between maintaining the 
secrecy of the information within a database and the integrity of the database. A database designer 
has added responsibility to see to the continued consistency of the database despite the need to 
present multiple views to its users. Enforcing secrecy through polyinstantiation results in the loss 
of real-world entity integrity and increases the complexity of the data relationships within the 
database. Due to this added complexity, as well as the unintentional ways in which 
polyinstantiation may be mistakenly invoked, increased administrative burden is also a problem.

3.1.1	Loss of Real-World Entity Integrity

Intuitively, a standard relational database represents a single non-contradictory view of the real 
world. Adding multilevel security and polyinstantiation support means that the relational database 
must now represent multiple views, potentially one or more for each classification level 
represented in the database. Whereas in a non-MLS database each tuple in a relation would 
normally represent a unique instance of a real-world entity, in an MLS DBMS this one-for-one 
relationship does not necessarily hold true and ambiguity becomes a problem.

To address secrecy-threatening signaling issues, low level users must be prevented from learning 
any information about higher level views. Polyinstantiation provides a means of hiding high views 
from low users. However, with polyinstantiation, realworld entity integrity may now only be 
ensured within a level and not across multiple levels. Further, a user of the database whose 
authorization spans more than one classification level will now be in the position of having to 
choose from multiple views. If the database presents views which contain contradictory data 
without associated explanation, the user may be faced with an inconsistent situation [Cholvy 94].

As described in Section 2.0, multiple tuples with the same apparent primary key could represent 
either (1) separate real-world entities modeled with the same key in the database, or (2) a single 
real-world entity modeled differently at different security levels. In non-MLS DBMSs, the first 
case violates the property that primary keys be unique. A non-MLS DBMS would simply prohibit 
the addition of a second tuple with the same key as an existing tuple. However, in an MLS 
environment, this prohibition may conflict with confidentiality requirements. If the existing tuple 
is at a higher security level than the proposed second tuple, prohibiting the addition of the second 
tuple will signal the existence of the higher level tuple. This consequence is at the core of the tuple 
polyinstantiation problem. Since the user inserting the new tuple cannot be informed of the 
existence of the higher level tuple, one cannot determine whether the user is entering data about 
the same real-world entity.

The relational theory of normalization has been studied as a way to address polyinstantiation and 
the relationship of integrity to secrecy [Qian 92, 94]. The notion of integrity is problematic for 
MLS DBMSs. Qian argues that if integrity constraints serve as a filter on how much low-level data 
can flow high then the case of a low datum contradicting a high datum would neither be apparent 
at a particular level (violating integrity) nor would either datum need to be disallowed (causing loss 
of information and introducing a signaling channel). Likewise, the notion of secrecy is problematic 
in the presence of integrity constraints. Again, it is argued that if update semantics are adopted that 
permit high-level users to gain access to low-level data only as long as integrity is preserved, then 
signaling channels are eliminated: Low updates are not denied due to high data, and high updates 
will not cause low data to change. Qian concludes that the detection of deductive inference 
channels is a special case of integrity protection: integrity implies the absence of deductive 
inference channels. Thus, according to Qian, the relationship between integrity and secrecy are not 
necessarily in fundamental conflict.

3.1.2	Increased Database Complexity to the User

Polyinstantiation can result from a number of scenarios:

1.	A user intentionally introducing a cover story against data stored at a higher level.

2.	Automatic polylow or polyhigh polyinstantiation correctly acting to counter the signaling 
threat which would result from announcing the existence of higher data when a user (or 
malicious code acting on a user's behalf) modifies or inserts data already stored at another 
level.

3.	A user who, by failing to check whether the data being added is referenced already at a 
lower level, mistakenly modifies a relation at a level higher than necessary. (This is 
especially a concern associated with executing at the wrong level an automated program 
possessing only limited checks.)

4.	A data regrade in progress in which a high user adds a tuple at the new level (low or high), 
but has not yet deleted the old tuple.

Given the wide range of reasons which can be the cause of a database demonstrating the effects of 
polyinstantiation, the increased complexity to interpret what is actually signified by what is stored 
in the database is obvious.

For example, consider the following scenario using a tuple level labeling DBMS. Given the 
following relation:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Defiant

Repair

Talos

S

Enterprise

Exploration

Talos

U

An operator is provided the Secret information that the Enterprise should prepare for a spying 
mission. By mistake, the operator updates this information as a TS-user, creating the following 
relation:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise

Spy

Talos

TS

Defiant

Repair

Talos

S

Enterprise

Exploration

Talos

U

Another operator is relayed the information that the destination of the Secret Enterprise mission is 
Rigel. Logging in as an S-user and making this straightforward addition creates the following table:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise

Spy

Talos

TS

Enterprise

Exploration

Rigel

S

Defiant

Repair

Talos

S

Enterprise

Exploration

Talos

U

On a far outpost, a new supply ship is christened with the name Defiant and a U-user adds this 
information as the ship sets out for Talos, unaware this name is already taken by a secret military 
ship.



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise

Spy

Talos

TS

Enterprise

Exploration

Rigel

S

Defiant

Repair

Talos

S

Defiant

null

Talos

U

Enterprise

Exploration

Talos

U

Now suppose the Romulans attack Talos and in this crisis situation you are given the task of 
querying the database to determine which resources are near the front. How difficult will it be to 
determine what is reality vs. cover story vs. database entry error?

An operational polyinstantiating database may be subject to a number of inputs over its lifetime 
which can create similar ambiguous and/or spurious tuples. Mechanisms and enforcement of 
administrative procedures will be needed to periodically cleanup undesired polyinstantiation 
effects. The additional burden to database administration is discussed in the following section.

3.1.3	Increased Database Administration

Real-world use of databases enforcing polyinstantiation will demand additional duties of the 
database administrator, as well as greater effort on the part of the users. Users must be careful not 
to cause unwanted polyinstantiation. Inadvertent and unwanted polyinstantiation may result due to 
clumsy user error, incorrect use of functionality, or *-property anomalies which result from 
operations being performed from the wrong level by a user or automated function. Undesired 
polyinstantiation will create additional clean-up issues for the database administrator. All of these 
increased database administration issues are experienced with tuple-level labeling databases, and 
become ever more problematic for element-level labeling databases.

Depending upon the specific decomposition and materialization algorithms with which 
polyinstantiation is enforced, a database may also become cluttered with what may be considered 
spurious tuples. In the original element-level label SeaView model [Lunt 90], a single update 
operation could create a number of tuples equal to the product of the number of tuples in each of 
the affected domains.

For example, in the original SeaView, an S-user issuing an update to the following relation:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Talos                U

U

to state that the Enterprise's mission was actually spying at Rigel, would generate the following 
tuples:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Talos                U

U

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Rigel                 S

S

Enterprise         U

Spying               S

Talos                U

S

Enterprise         U

Spying               S

Rigel                 S

S

The polyinstantiation integrity property enforced by SeaView requires that the key and its 
classification determine each attribute and its classification via multivalued dependency (see 
Section 4.2). If the user updating the relation believes the second and third tuples are spurious, 
clean-up tasks are required to remove them. Further discussion of spurious tuples and techniques 
to minimize them is presented in Section 4.2's detailed discussion of decomposition and 
materialization algorithms.

The enforcement of polyinstantiation may also cause the database administrator to be subject to 
complaints about database performance and increased requests for database tuning to improve it. 
Depending upon the implementation and the number of instances across levels, the overhead 
associated with polyinstantiation may significantly slow query performance.

A final administrative issue is interoperation with resident and subsequently acquired database 
applications. Untrusted applications written for standard versions of DBMS products may be 
incompatible with polyinstantiation enforcement, and may behave unpredictably when 
polyinstantiation is encountered. A database administrator will have additional duties to ensure that 
introduced tools or utilities will not "break" the database's integrity, and that the tools will not 
break or produce erroneous results.

3.2	A SIMPLE, BUT UNACCEPTABLE, ALTERNATIVE TO 
POLYINSTANTIATION

A simple solution may be theorized that enforces "secure" alternatives to both visible and invisible 
polyinstantiations. These alternatives are secure in the sense of secrecy and information flow, and 
preserve primary key requirements in multilevel relations; but unfortunately, they suffer from 
denial of service and integrity problems. The following two rules describe this solution:

1.	Whenever a high user makes an update which violates the uniqueness requirement, we 
simply refuse that update.

2.	Whenever a low user makes a change that conflicts with the uniqueness requirement, the 
conflicting high data is overwritten in place by the low data.

It is not difficult to see that this simple alternative to polyinstantiation preserves the uniqueness 
requirement in multilevel relations. This solution is also secure in the sense of secrecy and 
information flow. Although this solution may be acceptable in some specific situations, it is clearly 
unacceptable as a general solution because it introduces serious denial-of-service and integrity 
problems.

3.3	AUTOMATIC VERSUS INTENTIONAL POLYINSTANTIATION

Two approaches to implementing polyinstantiation may be considered: instruct a system to 
automatically polyinstantiate whenever an action by a high or low user opens a potential inference 
channel, or polyinstantiate only when manually directed to by a high user and handle any 
remaining inference channel concerns through some other means. The more general approach of 
automatic polyinstantiation is the prevalent method which has been investigated, but restricting 
polyinstantiation to occur only upon a user's request eliminates many of the automatic 
polyinstantiation approach's shortcomings.

Intentional polyinstantiation refers to user-directed polyinstantiation, generally in support of 
creating cover stories that lead to alternative explanations and the forestalling of an inferential 
chain resulting in unauthorized disclosure of information [Garvey 91]. Cover stories must be 
designed to purposely mislead the lower user with a plausible explanation and prevent the 
inference of the classified value. To be effective, a cover story usually requires consistency.

Some researchers assert that cover stories are the only valid reason for the use of polyinstantiation 
[Burns 90, 91]. The complexity and confusion caused by automatic polyinstantiation, especially 
when likely blunders by unsophisticated users are acknowledged, supports this argument for 
implementing only intentional polyinstantiation. The ability for complexity arising from 
polyinstantiation to impact a modeled mission was illustrated in Section 3.1.2. These researchers 
would advocate alternatives to polyinstantiation where cover stories are not explicitly needed. It 
may be argued that polyinstantiation is not a fundamental property of multilevel databases. Rather, 
polyinstantiation simply provides a powerful technique for supporting cover stories. Other 
research has sought to demonstrate that polyinstantiation is not even essential for supporting cover 
stories, and may be considered a poor technique since it is difficult to prevent spurious cover stories 
from occurring [Wiseman 90].

The problem of maintaining global consistency remains in databases that restrict polyinstantiation 
to intentional polyinstantiation. High users who query the database and are returned high level data 
and low level cover stories without explanation are still faced with an inconsistent situation.

One approach to this complexity is to assume that the higher the level view of a database the more 
reliable it is, and that the other views should be considered cover stories [Cholvy 94]. In the case 
of databases with partial ordering, Cholvy and Cuppens suggest that topics be associated with the 
data. Topics allow representation of semantic links between data, and may be used to parameterize 
the order of the security levels and to merge data with this finer grain of preference. The database 
administrator would define an order of preference for merging information related to a specific 
topic.

For example, consider a database which includes Unclassified and Secret hierarchical 
classifications and two compartments: Destination and Cargo. The topics dest and freight are 
defined against the database. The order of preference specified for merging information related to 
these two topics may vary. For instance, the total order of preference defined for merging 
information related to the topic dest might be:

(S, {Destination, Cargo}) > dest(S, Destination) > dest(S, Cargo) > destU

while the total order of preference for the topic freight might be:

(S, (Destination, Cargo)) > freight(Si Cargo) > freight(Si Destination) > freightU

The order of preference between these two topics differ because, according to the specific need to 
know of users at level (S, Cargo), information related to the topic freight is more reliable at level 
(S, Cargo) than at level (S, Destination) and the opposite is true for information related to the topic 
dest.

Another approach is to create two different attributes named Cargo and Freight which are classified 
at different global levels. These could be used as a means of controlling the two different views 
without ambiguity [Hinke 75].

3.4	ARCHITECTURAL CONSIDERATIONS IN SUPPORTING 
POLYINSTANTIATION

An MLS DBMS may be designed and built using a number of different architectures. The adopted 
architecture is closely tied to the range of polyinstantiation strategies available for a given system. 
Two primary architectures may be defined based on whether the database is trusted with respect to 
MAC [NAP 83]. In this section, we briefly discuss these two architectures in order to identify their 
influence on polyinstantiation strategies.

Figures 3.1 and 3.2 illustrate the two approaches. Figure 3.1 illustrates the No MAC Privileges 
(NMP) architecture. Separate databases store data at each classification level. Each DBMS 
process can access all databases with data at or below its level.

A variation to the NMP approach is for each DBMS to contain data at a given level and replicated 
data from all lower databases. The SINTRA database system prototype has adopted this replicated 
distributed approach with MAC enforcement by a trusted frontend, physical separation as a 
protection measure, and no modification to untrusted backend DBMSs [Kang 94]. The SINTRA 
architecture boasts greater data retrieval performance because a user's view is materialized from a 
single database, rather than across multiple single level database fragments.

Figure 3.1: No MAC Privileges Architecture

Figure 3.2 illustrates the Trusted Subject architecture. A single database is used to store data at 
multiple levels, and the DBMS is trusted (i.e., has MAC privilege) to guard against illegal 
information flows.

Figure 3.2: Trusted Subject Architecture

Polyinstantiation is a natural consequence of the NMP architecture. Since a lower-level DBMS has 
no knowledge of higher-level data, there is no way to prevent lower-level subjects from making 
updates that conflict with higher-level data. Requiring all keys to be classified at the lowest level 
protects against tuple polyinstantiation, but element polyinstantiation could still occur. 
Furthermore, this requirement may not be suitable for all applications. A specific approach to avoid 
this problem is discussed in Section 4.4.2. Element polyinstantiation may be allowed by defining 
logical relations that span multiple levels. The underlying databases would store single-level 
fragments of the relations. Restrictions on fragmentation are the first method to control the types 
of polyinstantiation semantics allowed within a system. If relations are fragmented, the fragments 
must be integrated to provide a coherent response to a query. Sections 4 and 5 discuss a number of 
approaches to integrating data.

The controls to prevent illegal information flow, which are built into the OS TCB in the NMP 
architecture, must be implemented through trusted software in the DBMS part of the TCB in the 
Trusted Subject architecture. For some applications it may be desirable to permit certain channels 
and avoid polyinstantiation. In general, this is easier to do in a Trusted Subject architecture where 
the DBMS portion of the TCB has access to all data levels, than in the NMP architecture where 
each DBMS instance can only observe data at levels it dominates.

SECTION 4

POLYINSTANTIATION APPROACHES

A number of different approaches can be used to implement polyinstantiation in a database 
management system reflecting divergent perspectives on the meaning and uses of polyinstantiation 
within an MLS environment. Each perspective has its strengths and its weaknesses, and the correct 
choice of approach depends on the requirements of specific applications. Different applications 
will be built to model different understandings of and requirements for multilevel data. Some 
approaches are only appropriate for databases enforcing element-level labeling, and as such may 
not be applicable to current commercial DBMS efforts which enforce tuple-level labeling.

This section introduces an example which will be used to examine various polyinstantiation 
approaches. Our discussion starts with approaches to MLS DBMS design that rely upon 
polyinstantiation and propagation of tuples to reflect different meaningful combinations of 
attribute values. Next, the section presents strategies that answer users' queries by using the 
security levels of retrieved tuples to derive new tuples. The last group of approaches places explicit 
restrictions on users' views of data, and includes approaches which permit complete avoidance of 
polyinstantiation. While this section presents a wide range of options, no claim is made that its 
exploration of polyinstantiation approaches is exhaustive. Likewise, alternative approaches toward 
the express goal of avoidance of polyinstantiation may be theorized, including careful auditing of 
channel usage, and constraints on the levels allowed in the DBMS.

4.1	AN EXAMPLE FOR COMPARING POLYINSTANTIATION APPROACHES

This section provides a detailed example that is used by the rest of Section 4 and Section 5 to 
compare and contrast approaches to polyinstantiation. Some of these approaches use 
polyinstantiation, while others add restrictions to eliminate the need for polyinstantiation. We use 
the same relation as previously, SOD, with the attributes Starship, Objective, and Destination. We 
assume for simplicity that the subjects and objects in our database may be described by simple 
hierarchical levels -- for example U and S. Furthermore, we assume here that the Starship attribute 
is always Unclassified. Therefore, the classification range of the Starship attribute has lower and 
upper bounds of U. Suppose, however, that both the Objective and Destination attributes have a 
classification range with a lower bound of U and an upper bound of S. Figure 4.1 shows the schema 
of this new relation, SODc.

The Tuple Class security label, abbreviated as TC, gives us the classification of the entire tuple. 
TC is a redundant (computed) security label whose value is the least upper bound of the 
classifications associated with the individual attributes in a tuple. The range of TC is derived in an 
obvious way from the classification ranges of the individual attributes.

Starship is the apparent primary key of SOD. Intuitively, this means that if SODc contained only 
single-level data, then Starship would be the actual primary key of the relation. If SODc contains 
Unclassified and Secret data, however, the actual primary key of SODc would be Starship along 
with the classifications associated with the attributes. This primary key concept is central to the 
polyinstantiation problem and is formally stated in the next section.

Figure 4.1: Multilevel Scheme for the Relation SODc

An instance of SODc is likely to contain tuples at different levels. Therefore, it is important to 
distinguish between the U-instance of SODc, visible to Unclassified users, and the S-instance, 
visible to Secret users. Increasing a user's clearance level should keep all previously visible 
information intact and perhaps add some new facts visible only at the higher level. For example, 
consider the U-instance of SODc given in Figure 4.2. It contains exactly one tuple, meaning that, 
as far as Unclassified users are concerned, the starship Enterprise has set out to explore Talos.

Figure 4.2: U-Instance of SODc

Figure 4.3 enumerates eight different S-instances of SODc, all of which are consistent with the U-
instance of Figure 4.2. Their common property is that the single tuple of the U-instance appears in 
all eight S-instances. Each tuple in an instance of SODc defines a mission for the starship in 
question. A U-instance of SODc allows only one mission per starship. S-instances, on the other 
hand, allow up to four missions (pairs of Objective and Destination) per starship, three of which 
are Secret and one Unclassified.

To gain further intuition into the polyinstantiation problem, consider instance 8 of Figure 4.3. This 
instance contains four tuples for the starship Enterprise. The classification associated with the 
Objective and Destination attributes makes each tuple distinct.

Figure 4.3: Eight S-Instances of SODc

The eight S-instances of SODc can be partitioned into three classes as follows:

1.	Instance 1 has no polyinstantiation.

2.	Instances 2, 3, and 4 have a single U-tuple (a) and a single S-tuple (b) for the Enterprise. 
The U-tuple could be interpreted as a cover story for the correct information in the S-tuple. 
Instances 2, 3, and 4 show a cover story applied against different aspects of higher 
classified information. For example, instance 2 has a cover story for the objective but not 
the destination, while instance 3 has a cover story for the destination but not the objective.

3.	Instances 5, 6, 7, and 8 are, however, confusing to interpret if it is assumed that higher level 
data correctly represent the real world. Each of these cases has more than one S-tuple for 
the Enterprise, but only one U-tuple. Nonetheless, a meaningful and consistent 
interpretation and update semantics for such relations may be developed [Jajodia 90a, 
90c].

4.2	PROPAGATION APPROACH

One way to implement polyinstantiation is termed the propagation approach The perspective that 
polyinstantiation is inherent in an MLS DBMS reflects the idea that, in the real world, people with 
different security clearances may see different information about the same entity. Similarly, MLS 
DBMS users at different levels may see different attribute values for the same real-world entity 
(e.g., an Unclassified cover story for a starship's destination), and the users' updates will reflect 
these different views. New tuples are added to reflect the different attribute values. The number of 
polyinstantiated tuples may be quite large under this approach to polyinstantiation.

The propagation approach must meet two requirements:

1.	Ensuring that keys still function to uniquely identify tuples in the database, and

2.	Controlling the propagation of tuples to include only meaningful combinations of attribute 
values.

The first requirement can be met by augmenting the apparent key with a security level and 
enforcing the standard key uniqueness property over this augmented key. The second requirement 
is more difficult to meet and researchers are still debating which types of combinations are 
meaningful. In general, multivalued dependencies (see [Date 83] for a more detailed explanation) 
are used to define the particular combinations allowed by a specific solution. While many variants 
are possible, the SeaView project [Denning 87, 88a, 88b; Lunt 89, 90, 91] and the proposed 
modifications of Jajodia and Sandhu [Jajodia 90b] provide the basis of this approach. First, we 
present the original SeaView approach, then Jajodia's and Sandhu's proposed modification, and 
finally some new techniques subsequently proposed by the SeaView project.

The goal of the SeaView project was to design an MLS relational database management system 
that satisfies the TCSEC for Class A1 [DoD 85]. It is claimed that the SeaView design and 
architecture can satisfy the A1 requirements simply by hosting it on an A1 operating system to 
which Trusted Oracle has been ported. This has not been done because no A1 OS is available 
[Hsieh 93, Lunt 94]. 

SeaView solves the problem of polyinstantiation of key attributes themselves by defining an entity 
integrity property. This property requires all attributes in a key to be uniformly classified. That is, 
for any instance Rc of a multilevel relation schema Rc, for any tuple t ¿ Rc, and for any attributes 
Ai and Aj in the apparent primary key KR of R, t[Ci] = t[Cj]. Notice that this means it is possible 
simply to define a single security label CK to represent the classification level of all attributes in 
the apparent primary key. Further, no tuples may have null values for key attributes. This 
restriction ensures that keys can be meaningfully specified and checked for uniqueness. In 
addition, all non-key attribute classifications must dominate CK. This restriction guarantees that if 
a user can see any part of a tuple, then he can see the key.

To meet the first challenge, that of using keys to determine when tuples model distinct real-world 
entities, SeaView defines a polyinstantiation integrity property, described below. The formulation 
of polyinstantiation integrity in SeaView consists of two distinct parts. The first part consists of a 
functional dependency component whose effect is to prohibit polyinstantiation within the same 
access class. The second part consists of a multivalued dependency requirement.

SeaView Polyinstantiation Integrity Property: A multilevel relation Rc satisfies 
polyinstantiation integrity (PI) if and only if for every Rc there are for all Ai ¿ KR:

1.	KR, CK, Ci > Ai

2.	KR, CK >> Ai, Ci

(The above single arrow is simple functional dependency; the double arrow represents multivalued 
functional dependency.) The PI property can be regarded as implicitly defining what is meant by 
the primary key in a multilevel relation. The primary key of a multilevel relation is KR » CK u CR 
(where CR is the set of classification security labels for data attributes not in K) since from PI it 
follows that the functional dependency KR » CK » CR > AR holds (where AR consists of all 
attributes that are not in KR). For example, considering a U instance for the schema displayed in 
Figure 4.1, <the apparent primary key> (Starship) » <classification level of all attributes in the 
apparent primary key> `U' » <set of classification security labels for data attributes not in the 
primary key> `S' > (Objective, Destination).

The inclusion of the multivalued dependency in the definition of polyinstantiation integrity means 
that one update may result in a number of tuples being added to the relation. To illustrate, consider 
the situation in which an S-user attempts to go from S-instance 1 to S-instance 4 in Figure 4.3 by 
inserting the Secret tuple specifying the secret mission of spying on Rigel. SeaView will interpret 
this as a request to go from S-instance 1 to S-instance 8, thereby manufacturing two additional 
missions for the Enterprise. Unfortunately, this increases the potential for such additional 
information, that may not reflect true data, to be retrieved from the database by users with higher 
clearances.

In fact, of the eight instances defined in Figure 4.3, SeaView's definition of polyinstantiation 
integrity allows only two combinations of these eight instances within a single relation scheme. 
Specifically, a SeaView relation can accommodate either instances 1, 2, 3, and 8 or instances 1 and 
4 within a single scheme in the absence of the uniform classification constraint. SeaView admits 
only instances 1 and 4 if the Objective and Destination attributes are uniformly classified (i.e., 
either both are classified U or both S).

It is easy to see that, in the worst case, the number of manufactured tuples grows at the rate of | 
security-latticel | k, where k is the number of non-key attributes in the relation. For instance, Figure 
4.4 shows a TS-instance of a relation similar to SOD, except that it has a range of four security 
levels for the Objective and Destination attributes. The particular TS-instance shown there 
describes four missions for the Enterprise, one each at the Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, and 
Top Secret levels.

Figure 4.4: TS-Instance of SOD With Four Missions

The definition of polyinstantiation integrity in SeaView requires that this information be 
represented by the sixteen missions shown in Figure 4.5. Users with clearances of U, C, S, and TS 
will respectively see 1, 4, 9, and 16 missions with the SeaView approach.

Jajodia et al., propose dropping the multivalued dependency from the polyinstantiation integrity 
property defined in the SeaView model [Jajodia 90a]. The authors argue that the multivalued 
dependency prohibits the existence of relation instances that are desirable in practice. Specifically, 
they argue that it is possible to accommodate all eight instances of Figure 4.3. Jajodia has 
developed formal operational semantics for these update operations on multilevel relations 
[Jajodia 91a, 91b, 91c].

Figure 4.5: Propagated Tuples of SODc

Lunt and Hsieh of the SeaView team developed a semantics for the basic database manipulation 
operations (insert, update, and delete) [Lunt 91]. Based on these semantics, they propose a different 
definition for polyinstantiation integrity consisting of two separate pieces: (1) a state property 
containing the same functional dependency component, and (2) a transition property concerning a 
new dynamic multivalued dependency component. The latter property can be illustrated informally 
by an example from [Lunt 91].

Consider the multilevel relation scheme SOD (Starship, CStarship, Objective, CObjective, 
Destination, CDestination, TC), composed of three attributes with associated element-level security 
labeling, and the computed tuple security label TC. The Starship attribute is the apparent primary 
key of SOD. An instance SODc at a classification level c is assumed to satisfy the two constraints 
of the PI property.

Now, consider the following relation instance SODU:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise        U

Exploration        U

Talos              U

U

Suppose a Confidential user changes the value of Objective to "Mining," as shown here:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise        U

Exploration        U

Talos              U

U

Enterprise        U

Mining               C

Talos              U

C

Under the update semantics of [Lunt 91], whenever an update involves some, but not all, of the 
non-key attributes, certain dynamic multivalued dependencies are enforced in the multilevel 
relations. In the example, the dynamic multivalued dependencies are:

Starship CStarship '' (Objective, CObjective) | (Destination, CDestination)

where the notation X '' Y | Z denotes the multivalued dependencies X '' Y and X '' Z.

Next, suppose a TS user updates the value of Destination to equal "Rigel." As before, since this 
update involves some (but not all) of the nonkey attributes, the dynamic multivalued dependency 
property causes two more tuples to be added to the relation:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise        U

Exploration        U

Talos              U

U

Enterprise        U

Mining               C

Talos              U

C

Enterprise        U

Exploration        U

Rigel              TS

TS

Enterprise        U

Mining               C

Rigel              TS

TS

At this point, suppose a Secret user changes the value of the Objective to "Spying." The following 
relation instance will result:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise        U

Exploration        U

Talos              U

U

Enterprise        U

Mining               C

Talos              U

C

Enterprise        U

Exploration        U

Rigel              TS

TS

Enterprise        U

Mining               C

Rigel              TS

TS

Enterprise        U

Spying               S

Talos               U

S

Enterprise        U

Spying               S

Rigel              TS

TS

As stated in [Lunt 91], the way in which an update occurs determines whether or not the 
multivalued dependency should be enforced. Essentially, if two or more attributes were updated in 
a single update statement, the multivalued dependency would not be enforced. However, if the two 
attributes were updated in two independent operations, the multivalued dependency would be 
enforced. This dynamic approach has not been formalized, nor is it being incorporated into the 
SeaView prototype.

4.3	DERIVED VALUES APPROACH

A second perspective on polyinstantiation is that although a multilevel relation may have several 
tuples for the same real-world entity, there should be only one such tuple per classification level. 
Instead of a classification level Ci associated with each attribute Ai, the schema Rc includes a single 
classification level for each tuple, TC. When a user wants to update only certain attributes at a 
particular level, the values of the other attributes will be derived from values at lower security 
levels.

Consider the following relation SOD where Starship is the key:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise

Exploration

Talos

U

Now suppose an S-user wishes to modify the destination of the Enterprise to be Rigel. He can 
simply do so by inserting a new Secret tuple to SOD as follows:

(Enterprise, û, Rigel, S)

The symbol û is to be interpreted as follows: For this S-tuple the value of the Objective field is 
identical to the corresponding U-tuple in SOD. As a consequence, when an S-user asks for the SOD 
relation to be materialized, he sees the following:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise

Exploration

Talos

U

Enterprise

Exploration

Rigel

S

The relation will appear unchanged to the U-user.

The Lock Data Views (LDV) project [Haigh 91] follows this derived data approach.

The derived data approach has been implemented for the United States Transportation Command 
Air Mobility Command MLS Global Decision Support System (GDSS) [Nelson 91]. The MLS 
GDSS implementation limits polyinstantiation in a multilevel relation to at most one tuple per 
security class. Information is labeled at one of two levels, U or S. The design is based on the 
organization's assumption that when S and U data are integrated into a single S response, the S data 
takes precedence over the U data. This design can be extended to environments with more than two 
strictly ordered security levels. Organizations for which this strict hierarchical rule does not apply, 
such as many compartmented environments, would need to incorporate substantial changes into 
this design in order to use it.

In the MLS GDSS application, trusted application software functionally extends the commercial 
off-the-shelf (COTS) MLS DBMS to manage tuple-level polyinstantiation. Before inserting an S-
tuple, the trusted software ensures that a U-tuple exists with the same key. If it does not exist, the 
insertion of an S tuple is not permitted. If a U-tuple with the same apparent primary key does exist, 
the trusted application software examines each S-tuple attribute value, except the apparent key 
value, and determines if it replicates the attribute's value in the U-tuple. If so, the value is not 
replicated in the S-tuple but instead is set to null, minimizing data replication. The U-tuple thus 
serves as the foundation upon which the S-tuple is built. The MLS GDSS solution is best explained 
with several examples. Consider the following relation:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise

Exploration

Talos

U

Now suppose an S-user wishes to modify the destination of the Enterprise to Rigel. The S-user 
directs the system, through the trusted software, to insert an S-tuple into the SOD as follows:

S-USER:

Insert into SOD

(Starship, Objective, Destination)

Values (`Enterprise', `Exploration', `Rigel');

The U and S tuples are now stored in the relation as follows:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise

Exploration

Talos

U

Enterprise

null

Rigel

S

By reducing the replication of data across polyinstantiated tuples, the probability of maintaining 
the integrity of the database improves. Additionally, except for the key value, the sensitivity level 
of all attribute values contained within the stored tuple are equivalent to the TC value. Given this 
equivalence to the TC value, trusted application software derives attribute value labels from the TC 
value. Users operating at the U-level are presented with a display showing the derived attribute 
value labels as follows:



Starship

Objective

Destination

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Talos               U

Users operating at the S-level are presented with a single composite display of a materialized tuple. 
This materialized tuple comprises S and U data as follows:



Starship

Objective

Destination

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Rigel                U

One of the major impacts of this derived values polyinstantiation approach, as implemented in the 
MLS GDSS, involves the DBMS join operator at the S-level. Figure 4.6 illustrates the simplest 
form of this problem which needed to be addressed by GDSS. A typical join operation between 
two tables matches and retrieves rows based on the primary key Starship. In order to retrieve data 
residing at the same security level, and thus permit proper collapsing of the rows into a materialized 
tuple, the join is further qualified by the row's security label attribute TC:

S-USER:

Select * from Table 1, Table 2

where Table 1.Starship = Table 2.Starship and Table 1.TC = Table 2.TC

An important functional requirement in MLS GDSS is that S-users expect to see S-data as the end 
product of a retrieval, if S-data exists; otherwise, U-data is returned. Case 1 in Figure 4.6 shows a 
join between two tables that produces the correct materialized tuple for an S user. Case 2 illustrates 
the anomaly associated with the join. In this case, Table 2 contains only U-data. Since the query 
requires that the tuple labels must match, the query does not return the S-row of Table 1 to be joined 
with the U-row of Table 2. Thus, if data does not exist at the same security levels in each table, 
then information may be lost during the join operation.

In this simplified example, one might argue that removing the qualification that the tables must be 
joined by tuple labels would permit joins. Doing this would return two rows in Case 2, one 
containing only U information, and the other containing S and U information. If this approach were 
taken, the tuple materialization process would become more complex and would need to extract 
multiple tuple labels and assign them to the appropriate columns in the row that was returned. Also, 
the join example shown in Case 1 would result in four rows of data returned from the server, 
instead of just two. The complexity of the problem and the work required of the DBMS server 
would increase significantly as more tables were joined. Database server performance would 
decrease accordingly, perhaps to unacceptable levels.

Result of Join at S Level

Figure 4.6: Joins in GDSS

In order to ensure the correct materialization of a logical joined tuple, MLS GDSS does not 
currently use the join capabilities of the MLS COTS DBMS. Instead, tuples are selected from 
individual tables and then joined outside the DBMS by GDSS application software. While this 
operation results in some processing overhead, it ensures that data are not accidentally excluded 
from the S-user without unsupported modification to the COTS DBMS itself.

4.4	VISIBLE RESTRICTIONS APPROACH

The third perspective on polyinstantiation is that users are made aware that data are restricted to 
certain levels. In practice, this perspective means that users are cognizant of the levels of data that 
they can see and update. The goal is to provide a more "honest" database without compromising 
security. This perspective can lead to many different approaches; this section presents five 
different possibilities, including techniques to eliminate the need for polyinstantiation.

4.4.1	Belief Approach

One visible restrictions approach to polyinstantiation is motivated by the idea that data at each level 
should reflect the "beliefs" of users at that level about the real world [Smith 92]. For simplicity, we 
call this work the belief approach. In this approach, users see all the data that they could read per 
the Bell-LaPadula model, but believe the highest level data dominated by their operating level.

In this approach, updates reflect beliefs about the real world and they are regulated by the following 
property:

Update Access Property: Data at a particular level can only be inserted, modified, or 
deleted by users at that level.

Thus, data at each level reflects the beliefs of the users who maintain it. Users may see the data that 
they believe as well as data believed by users at lower levels.

At the heart of this property is a model that takes a stand between tuple- and element-level 
polyinstantiation. Keys may be classified at a different level than other attributes within the same 
tuple, but all non-key attributes within a single tuple share a classification level.

Given a relation schema R, the multilevel relation Rc used in the belief model includes two 
additional classification attributes: a key classification level (Kc) and a tuple classification level 
(Tc). The model imposes two restrictions:

1.	In any tuple, Tc must dominate Kc.

2.	For the set of key attributes K and for all non-key attributes .Ai,...,An in Rc,

K, Kc, Tc ' Ai,...,An

Intuitively then, tuples with the same values for key attributes but different key classification levels 
refer to different real-world entities. Tuples that are identical in key attributes and key 
classification levels but differ in tuple classification levels represent different beliefs about the 
same real-world entities. To maintain this distinction, users at a particular level are not allowed to 
reuse key attribute values for new entities.

Given the relation SOD in Figure 4.7, in the belief model, U-users believe the first and second 
tuples. C-users believe the third tuple, and S-users believe the fourth and fifth tuples. The second 
and third tuples refer to the same real-world starship, but U- and C-users have different beliefs 
about its objective and destination. The first and fifth tuples refer to different starships.

Figure 4.7: Example of SOD in the Belief Model

U-users can see only the first two tuples in Figure 4.7, C-users can see the first three tuples, and S-
users can see all five tuples.

Although users are allowed to see all tuples at levels dominated by their belief levels, the query 
language includes the optional keyword BELIEVED BY to allow users to restrict queries further. 
Thus, S-users can ask to see all allowable tuples, or only those believed by C- and S-users, or 
others.

So, the query "Display the destination of all starships named Enterprise" is expressed as:

SELECT	Destination

FROM	SOD

WHERE	Starship = "Enterprise"

BELIEVED BY	ANYONE

The result of this query, when issued against the relation in Figure 4.7, is:

Destination

for a U-user, and



Destination

Tc

U

for all users at levels C or higher.

The query "Display the beliefs of U-users as to the destination of all starships named Enterprise" 
is expressed as:

SELECT	Destination

FROM	SOD

WHERE	Starship = "Enterprise"

BELIEVED BY	U

The result of this query, when issued against the relation in Figure 4.7, is:



Destination

Tc

Vulcan

U

for all users.

The query "Display the classification level and destination of all starships named Voyager" is 
expressed as:

SELECT	Kc, Destination

FROM	SOD

WHERE	Starship = "Voyager"

BELIEVED BY	ANYONE

The result of this query, when issued against the relation in Figure 4.7, is:



Kc

Destination

Tc

U

Mars

U

for U- and C-users, and



Kc

Destination

Tc

U

Mars

U

S

Rigel

S

for all users at levels S or higher.

4.4.2	Insert-Low Approach

Another variation of explicit restriction, the insert-low approach, has been adopted by the SWORD 
project at the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment in England [Wood 92]. In this approach, each 
relation is assigned a table usage classification, abbreviated as table class, at the time of its 
creation. Each attribute is assigned a column classification that must dominate the table class.

The purpose of the table class is two fold: First, any insertion or deletion of tuples in a relation can 
be made by users operating at the level of the table class of the relation. Second, the table class 
controls exactly how the updates involving an access class that dominates the table class can be 
made to the relation. This concept will be explained in greater detail below.

Consider once again the relation schema SOD. Say the table classification of SOD is U. 

A typical instance of SOD is given as follows:



Starship

Objective

Destination

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Talos                U

Voyager            U

Spying               S

Rigel                TS

In this case, SWORD will show the entire relation to TS-users, while for those users at lower levels, 
SWORD will substitute <not cleared> whenever a user has insufficient clearance to view a value. 
Thus, for example, a C-user will see the following instance:



Starship

Objective

Destination

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Talos                U

Voyager            U

<not cleared>

<not cleared>

To see how SWORD avoids tuple polyinstantiation, consider once again the relation SOD with U 
as its table class. Suppose the initial database state is as follows:



Starship

Objective

Destination

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Talos                U

Suppose some U-user inserts the tuple (Voyager, S, Spying, U, Talos, U) into SOD. SWORD 
allows lower level users to insert values at higher levels as long as the attribute value classifications 
are dominated by the appropriate column classification. In this example, the column classification 
for Starship would have to be S or higher. Furthermore, since the table classification of SOD is U, 
this constitutes a legal insertion, and as a result, U-users and S-users will see the following states, 
respectively:



Starship

Objective

Destination

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Talos                U

<not cleared>

Spying               U

Talos                U

U-user



Starship

Objective

Destination

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Talos                U

Voyager            S

Spying               U

Talos                U

S-user

At this point, suppose a U-user wants to make an insertion (Freedom, U, Mining, U, Mars, U) to 
SOD. Since the Starship attribute of tuples in SOD are not all visible to the U-user, there is always 
a possibility that the Starship value of the tuple to be inserted equals that of the existing high tuple, 
leading to element polyinstantiation (or tuple polyinstantiation in the case of attributes constituting 
the primary key). SWORD avoids this by prohibiting U-users from inserting or modifying values 
in this attribute. In the case of key attributes, like Starship, this means that all further insertions by 
U-users will be forbidden. However, since the table classification is U, only U-users can insert 
tuples into SOD. As a consequence, no further insertions can be made to SOD at all. In SWORD 
applications, then, the column classifications for all attributes constituting the primary key must 
equal the table class or users may be able to prohibit future insertions.

We next illustrate in more detail how element polyinstantiation is avoided in SWORD. Consider 
the SOD instance:



Starship

Objective

Destination

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Talos                U

Next, suppose a TS-user wishes to modify the destination of the Enterprise to be Rigel. This is 
accomplished in two steps. First, the TS-user must log in as a U-user and change the classification 
of Talos from U to TS. Having done so, the TS-user can log in at his level and then make the desired 
update. As a result, the U instance and TS instance will become as follows:



Starship

Objective

Destination

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

<not cleared>

U-user



Starship

Objective

Destination

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Rigel               TS

TS-user

Given the database state shown immediately above, suppose an S-user wants to insert a Secret 
destination for the Enterprise. He may do so by first logging in as a U-user, changing the 
classification of the attribute Destination from TS to S. As a result of this change, all users, 
including the TS-user, will see the following relation:



Starship

Objective

Destination

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

<not cleared>   S

Now, the S-user can log in at classification level S and make the appropriate change.

4.4.3	Prevention Approach

A third approach to explicit restriction relies on preventative techniques to eliminate tuple 
polyinstantiation completely. Three basic techniques may be envisioned [Sandhu 91]:

1.	Make all the keys visible. In this technique, the apparent primary key is required to be 
labeled at the lowest level at which a relation is visible. For example, suppose that the 
designer requires that all keys must be unclassified. Consequently, the following relation 
would be forbidden:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Talos            U

U

Enterprise         S

Spying               S

Rigel             S

S

Instead, note that the following two relations, called USOD and SSOD, represent the same 
information:



UStarship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Talos            U

U

USOD



SStarship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         S

Spying               S

Rigel             S

S

SSOD

In other words, USOD and SSOD horizontally partition the original SOD relation, with all the U-
Starships in USOD and all the S-Starships in SSOD.

2.	Partition the domain of the primary key. Another way to eliminate tuple 
polyinstantiation is to partition the domain of the primary key among the various access 
classes possible for the primary key. For our example, suppose that the application requires 
that starships whose names begin with A-E be Unclassified, starships whose names begin 
with F-T be Secret, and so on. Whenever a new tuple is inserted, the system enforces this 
requirement as an integrity constraint. In this case, the Secret Enterprise must be renamed, 
perhaps as follows:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Talos            U

U

Voyager            S

Spying               S

Rigel             S

S

The DBMS can now reject any attempt by a U-user to insert a starship whose name begins 
with F-Z, without causing any information leakage or integrity violation.

3.	Limit insertions to be done by trusted subjects. A third way to eliminate tuple 
polyinstantiation is to require that all insertions must be done by a system-high user, with 
a write-down occurring as part of the insert operation. Strictly speaking, it is only 
necessary to have a relation-high user (i.e., a user to whom all tuples are visible). In the 
context of the example, this means that a U-user who wishes to insert the tuple (Enterprise, 
Exploration, Talos) must request an S-user to do the insertion. The S-user will do so by 
invoking a trusted subject that can check for key conflict, and if there is none, insert a U-
tuple by writing down. If there is a conflict the S-user informs the U-user about it, so the 
U-user can, for example, change the name of the starship.

The first technique is available in any DBMS that allows a range of access classes for individual 
attributes (or attribute groups) by simply limiting the classification range of the apparent key to be 
a singleton set. The second technique is available to any DBMS that can enforce domain 
constraints with adequate generality and trustworthiness. The third technique is always available 
but requires the use of trusted code, and tolerates some leakage of information (although with a 
human in the loop). The best technique will depend upon the characteristics of the DBMS and the 
application, particularly concerning the frequency and source of insertions.

In addition to the above, Sandhu's prevention approach also proposes techniques to prevent 
element polyinstantiation without compromising confidentiality, integrity, or denial-of-service 
requirements. The basic idea is to introduce a special symbol denoted by "restricted" as the 
possible value of a data element. The value "restricted" is distinct from any other value for that 
element and is also different from "null." In other words, the domain of a data element is its natural 
domain extended with "restricted" and "null." Sandhu then defines the semantics of "restricted" to 
be able to eliminate both polyhigh and polylow polyinstantiation [Sandhu 91].

Consider again the polyhigh scenario of Section 2.3. Begin with the following relation:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Talos            U

U

Next, suppose an S-user attempts to modify the destination of the Enterprise to be Rigel. This 
update does not cause any security violation, but if the new destination is classified Secret, 
additional steps are required to prevent even temporary polyinstantiation. The prevention approach 
requires an S-cleared user first to log in as a U-user and to mark the destination of the Enterprise 
as "restricted," giving the following relation:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

restricted      U

U

The meaning of <restricted, U> is that this field can no longer be updated by an ordinary U-user. 
U-users can therefore infer that the true value of the Enterprise's destination is classified at some 
level not dominated by U. The S-user then logs in as an S-subject and enters the destination of the 
Enterprise as Rigel, giving us the following relations at the U- and S-levels, respectively:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

restricted      U

U



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

restricted      U

U

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Rigel             S

S

Note that this protocol does not introduce a signaling channel from an S-subject to a U-subject. 
There is an information flow, but from an S-user (logged in as a U-subject) to a U-subject. This is 
an important distinction. This type of information flow, which includes humans in the process, 
cannot be completely eliminated without cover stories. However, this protocol does prevent 
malicious software from signaling information without the knowledge of users.

Next, consider how the polylow scenario of Section 2.3 works with the restricted requirement. In 
this case, the Enterprise can have a Secret destination only if the destination has been marked as 
being "restricted" at the Unclassified level. Thus, if the S- and U-users, respectively, see the 
following instances of SOD:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

restricted      U

U

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Rigel             S

S



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

restricted      U

U

then an attempt by a U-user to update the destination of the Enterprise to Talos will be



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

null                 U

U

rejected. Alternatively, if both S- and U-users see the following instance:

then the U-user update will be allowed (without causing polyinstantiation).

The concept of the "restricted" mark is straightforward, as long as the classification lattice is totally 
ordered. In the general case of a partially ordered lattice, some subtleties arise. How to completely 
eliminate polyinstantiation using "restricted" is discussed at length in [Sandhu 91]. In general, 
updating the value of an element to "restricted" cannot cause polyinstantiation. On the other hand, 
updating the value of an element to a data value, say, at the C-level, can be the cause of 
polyinstantiation. If polyinstantiation is to be completely prohibited, this update must require that 
the data element be restricted at all levels that do not dominate C. The fact that the data element is 
restricted at all levels below C can be verified by the usual integrity-checking mechanisms in a 
DBMS [Sandhu 90b]. However, it is difficult to guarantee this at levels incomparable with C. In 
preparing to enter a data value at the C level, the system would need to start a system-low (actually, 
a data-element-low) process that can then write up. A protocol for this purpose is described in 
[Sandhu 91].

4.4.4	Explicit Alternatives Approach

A fourth approach to explicit restriction allows the application developer to choose among explicit 
alternatives for polyinstantiation. Sandhu and Jajodia brought together a number of their 
previously published ideas, along with some new ones, to define a particular semantics for 
polyinstantiation called polyinstantiation for cover stories (PCS) [Sandhu 92]. PCS allows the 
developer to specify whether an attribute (or attribute group) of a multilevel tuple will support: (1) 
no polyinstantiation or (2) deliberate polyhigh polyinstantiation at the explicit request of a user to 
whom the polyinstantiation is visible. PCS strictly limits the extent of polyinstantiation by 
requiring that each real-world entity be modeled in a multilevel relation by at most one tuple per 
security class. The goal of PCS is to provide a natural, intuitive, and useful technique for 
implementing cover stories, with run-time flexibility regarding the use of cover stories. A 
particular attribute may be used for cover stories for some tuples and not for others. Even for the 
same real-world entity, a particular attribute may be polyinstantiated at some time and not at other 
times.

PCS combines the "one tuple per tuple class" concept with the "restricted" concept of Section 
4.4.3. The basic motivation for PCS can be appreciated by considering the following instance of 
SOD:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

restricted          U

Talos            U

U

Enterprise         U

Spying               S

Rigel             S

S

In this case, the Destination attribute of the Enterprise is polyinstantiated, so that <Talos, U> is a 
cover story for the real S destination of Rigel. The Objective is not polyinstantiated.

Consider the occurrence of polyinstantiation due to polylow, as discussed by the example in 
Section 2.3. This example begins with S- and U-users, respectively, having the following views of 
SOD:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Rigel             S

S



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

null               U

U

So far there is no polyinstantiation. Polyinstantiation occurs in the example when a U-user updates 
the destination of the Enterprise to be Talos.

PCS takes a slightly different approach to this example. According to the PCS approach, 
polyinstantiation does exist in the S-instance of SOD given above. PCS shows this instance as:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

null               U

U

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Rigel             S

S

In this approach, polyinstantiation already exists prior to the U-user updating the destination of the 
Enterprise to be Talos. This update merely modifies an already polyinstantiated relation instance 
to be:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Talos            U

U

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Rigel             S

S

With this approach, element polyinstantiation can occur only due to polyhigh. Polylow simply 
cannot be the cause of element polyinstantiation. Consequently, polyinstantiation will occur only 
by the deliberate action of a user to whom the polyinstantiation is immediately available. In other 
words, element polyinstantiation does not occur as a surprise.

The PCS approach treats null values like any other data value (except in the apparent key fields 
where null should not occur). Previous work on the semantics of null in polyinstantiated databases 
has taken the view that nulls are subsumed by non-null values independent of the access class 
[Jajodia 90b, Sandhu 90a]. In this case, the first tuple in the following relation available to S-users:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

null               U

U

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Rigel             S

S

is subsumed by the second tuple, resulting in the following relation for S-users used in the polylow 
example of Section 2.3:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Rigel             S

S

Under the explicit alternatives approach, the former relation is completely acceptable. The latter 
can be acceptable, but only if the lower limit on the classification of the destination attribute is S.

To further illustrate the semantics of null in PCS, consider the following relation:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

null                U

U

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

null                U

S

PCS considers this to be a polyinstantiated relation. The fact that there are nulls rather than data 
values in the polyinstantiated field has no bearing on the treatment of this relation. In contrast, the 
semantics of null in [Jajodia 90b] and [Sandhu 90a] require all null values to be classified at the 
level of the apparent key (U in this case), thereby deeming the second tuple illegal.

The PCS approach leaves many of the choices of whether or not to polyinstantiate to the discretion 
of application designer. It differentiates between updates that can and cannot cause 
polyinstantiation by using two different keywords (UPDATE and PUPDATE) to make the 
distinction explicit. The PCS approach also relies on the distinguished data value "restricted." The 
meaning of this data value is that users at a classification level which returns the value "restricted" 
for an attribute, may not modify the value of that attribute. As in the prevention approach (Section 
4.4.3), PCS includes special privileges for imposing and lifting such restrictions.

4.4.5	Multilevel Relational Data Model Approach

A fifth approach described here is an extension of the work just described in Section 4.4.4. The 
main benefits of this model, the Multilevel Relational (MLR) data model [Chen 95], over previous 
models is that it retains the capability for upward information flow while eliminating ambiguity of 
references by foreign keys.

This model, which supports attribute level labeling, requires that there be at most one tuple in each 
access class for a given entity. It requires that if a tuple includes attributes which are classified 
lower than the tuple's access class, then a tuple at this lower level must exist with the same attribute 
value. Because of this requirement, and the fact that the minimum classification of an element may 
be higher than that of the primary key, it allows classification attributes to be NULL for attributes 
which have NULL values. The model also requires that a tuple exist at a given level in order to 
recognize that tuple at that level (i.e., there is no automatic recognition of the validity of less 
sensitive data elements). The main ideas behind the model are as follows:

1.	The data accepted by a subject is divided into two parts: all data defined at the subject's 
level and any data explicitly "borrowed" from lower levels. Allowing data-borrow ensures 
that the MLR data model retains upward information flow because changes to lower level 
data can be automatically propagated to higher levels.

2.	A subject can see data which is accepted by subjects at its level or at the levels below it.

3.	A tuple contains all the data accepted (either owned or borrowed) by subjects at the level 
of the tuple. If a tuple at a given level does not exist, then subjects at that level do not accept 
the existence of that tuple.

The MLR data model is more precisely defined by the following five integrity properties as 
follows:

Entity Integrity:

Entity integrity (which comes from SeaView) protects the integrity of the apparent primary key 
(AK). It basically has three requirements which must be met by each tuple:

1.	No attributes in AK have a null value.

2.	The attributes in AK are uniformly classified.

3.	All non-key attributes must dominate the classification of AK.

Polyinstantiation Integrity:

This includes two requirements:

1.	There can only be one tuple at a given classification level for each unique AK.

2.	For each unique AK there can only be one attribute value at each attribute level (i.e., you 
cannot have multiple values for the same attribute at the same attribute level for a given 
AK).

Data Borrowed Integrity:

This property, which is new to this model, ensures that borrowed data actually exists and changes 
to lower level data can be automatically propagated to higher levels. It basically states that:

1.	In all tuples, for each non-null attribute that is less sensitive than the tuple classification, 
there must exist a tuple at the level of the attribute with the same attribute value and 
attribute classification (i.e., if you borrow less sensitive data, that data must exist).

Foreign Key Integrity:

This property, which also came from SeaView, basically states that:

1.	For each foreign key, all attributes of that key are either null or non-null.

2.	For each foreign key, all attributes of the key are uniformly classified.

Referential Integrity:

Referential integrity in the standard database model ensures that each foreign key references an 
existing primary key [Entity 96]. In this model, referential integrity states that:

1.	For each foreign key, there must be a matching AK.

2.	The classification of the foreign key must dominate the classification of the AK.

3.	The classification of the tuple containing the foreign key must equal the classification of 
the tuple containing the AK.

This not only ensures that matching primary keys exist and are visible to the referencing tuple, but 
also requires that the two tuples be classified at the same level. This last requirement means that 
for any level c, c-tuples can only reference c-tuples. This follows from the restriction that only 
tuples at a given level are accepted at that level.

The main benefit of this new restriction is that there is no ambiguity in any references by a foreign 
key. Without this restriction, a tuple's foreign key could match the primary key of multiple 
polyinstantiated tuples that are dominated by the tuple with the foreign key. This requirement 
eliminates this potential ambiguity.

The model is illustrated in the following examples:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Talos            U

U

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Rigel             S

S

Using our familiar example, the tuples above would be perfectly legal in the MLR data because 
each tuple has a different access class and there is a U tuple that has the same Starship and 
Objective attribute values as the S tuple (i.e., Enterprise and Exploration). The following would 
not be legal for two reasons: one because it contains two tuples with the same apparent primary 
key that have the same access class (i.e., S) and two because there is no matching Mining Objective 
attribute in the U tuple (i.e., two attributes at the same level for the same primary key have 
conflicting values).



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

Exploration        U

Talos            U

U

Enterprise         U

Mining               U

Rigel             S

S

Enterprise         U

Spying               S

Rigel             S

S

The following tuple illustrates the use of the "null" classification value capability. In this case, the 
objective is null. This feature is provided because attributes may have a minimum classification 
higher than the minimum classification of the primary key. In this example, the minimum 
classification for Objective could be Confidential. Without allowing null attribute and label values, 
there would be no way of creating a tuple at U which contains the Enterprise and Talos attribute 
values at U.



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

null                null

Talos            U

U

Given this initial tuple, the following tuples could build upon this base as follows:



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

null                null

Talos            U

U

Enterprise         U

Mining               S

Rigel             S

S

Enterprise         U

Spying             TS

Rigel             S

TS

These tuples indicate that the actual purpose of the Enterprise mission is to perform Spying on 
Rigel while cover stories of going to Talos or doing Mining are provided to less cleared 
individuals. If the Rigel destination was changed by an S user, then it would automatically 
propagate up to the TS tuple since it is being borrowed by that tuple. However, in the following 
tuple, a change to the Rigel destination at the S level would not be propagated, since (although) the 
destinations appear to be the same, that value was not borrowed from the lower level tuple.



Starship

Objective

Destination

TC

Enterprise         U

null                null

Talos            U

U

Enterprise         U

Mining              S

Rigel             S

S

Enterprise         U

Spying             TS

Rigel            TS

TS

This model includes the addition of a new SQL statement which is used to indicate borrowing from 
lower level tuples, the UPLEVEL statement. This statement is used to indicate which attributes to 
borrow from a lower level tuple. This statement can be used to modify an existing tuple or create 
a new one.

In summary, this model unifies a number of other models and then extends them in such a way as 
to retain upward information flow without permitting downward flows, while eliminating semantic 
ambiguity of foreign keys due to polyinstantiated elements within a reasonably flexible attribute 
level labeling scheme.

SECTION 5

CURRENT COMMERCIAL APPROACHES TO POLYINSTANTIATION

Previous sections of this document discussed various issues surrounding polyinstantiation in MLS 
DBMSs. This section summarizes the polyinstantiation approaches provided by three 
commercially available MLS DBMSs: INFORMIX, Sybase, and Oracle; and the Trusted Rubix 
DBMS commercial prototype.

Each of these DBMS products provides tuple level labeling, so element level labeling, and the 
polyinstantiation issues associated with it, are not applicable.

INFORMIX:

The key for a tuple in INFORMIX OnLine/Secure automatically includes the tuple security label. 
Thus, polyinstantiation is always possible and cannot be suppressed by the DBMS. INFORMIX 
OnLine/Secure places no special requirements on suppressing polyhigh or polylow 
polyinstantiation. It does not provide any tools for cleaning up polyinstantiation. Any 
housecleaning of polyinstantiation effects will require a manual procedure or custom software. 
[INFORMIX 92]

Sybase:

The tuple sensitivity in the Sybase Secure SQL Server is automatically part of all keys. Thus 
polyinstantiation is always possible and cannot be suppressed by the DBMS. Sybase Secure SQL 
Server does not provide any specific tools for cleaning up polyinstantiation. Any cleanup requires 
a manual procedure or custom software. [Sybase 93]

Oracle:

Trusted Oracle can be configured to run in one of two modes. When run in DBMS MAC mode, a 
single Trusted Oracle database can store information at multiple labels. In this mode, Trusted 
Oracle can turn polyinstantiation on and off at the table level by requiring key integrity which does 
not include the tuple label. When on, the primary key includes the tuple label, which allows 
poLyinstantiation to occur. When off, the key does not include the tuple label, thus preventing 
polyinstantiation. The ramifications of having polyinstantiation turned off is that high users cannot 
insert tuples above lower level tuples that already exist with the same primary key and vice versa, 
which causes denial of service (to some degree) for high users as well as a covert channel for low 
users.

Including or not including the tuple label in the primary key is specified at table definition time. 
The tuple label can be added to the primary key at some future date, which would then permit 
polyinstantiation. However, once the tuple label is included in the primary key, it cannot be 
removed. [Oracle 93]

When run in OS MAC mode, Trusted Oracle is capable of storing data at only a single label, and 
the DBMS is constrained by the underlying OS MAC policy. Without any MAC privilege, the 
DBMS cannot suppress polyinstantiation because a low DBMS will not be aware of any tuples 
with the same primary key at a higher level, and a high DBMS cannot be trusted to modify low 
data. As such, polyinstantiation cannot be prevented when Trusted Oracle is running in OS MAC 
mode.

Trusted Rubix:

Trusted Rubix provides the most flexible polyinstantiation mechanism of the products surveyed by 
its support of three polyinstantiation modes: POLYHIGH, POLYLOW, and what is referred to as 
POLYNONE. The selected mode is defined on a per table basis, when each table is created. Once 
a table had been created and the polyinstantiation discipline declared, it is not possible to change 
that discipline for the remainder of the table's lifetime. [Rubix 93]

POLYNONE

When this mode is selected for a table, polyinstantiation is prevented in that table, thus introducing 
a covert channel for low users and potentially preventing some inserts by high users.

POLYLOW

This mode causes HIGH keys to be replicated at LOW when a LOW subject attempts to insert an 
item whose key matches that of an extant HIGH item. This is done to avoid the covert channel 
problem. However, if a HIGH user attempts to insert a tuple which contains a key that already 
exists at a lower level, that insert is prevented.

POLYHIGH

This mode causes LOW keys to be replicated at HIGH when a HIGH subject attempts to insert an 
item whose key matches that of an extant LOW item. This is done to allow a high user to insert 
HIGH tuples when a LOW version already exists, rather than preventing duplication of keys at 
HIGH. This mode includes the characteristics offered by the POLYLOW mode since, in the 
Trusted Rubix implementation, it is not possible to support POLYHIGH behavior without 
supporting POLYLOW. This mode basically makes polyinstantiation of the Trusted Rubix table 
behave like a table which has had polyinstantiation turned on under Trusted Oracle DBMS MAC 
mode.

SECTION 6

SUMMARY

The design of an MLS DBMS must take into account the problem of polyinstantiation. When data 
items exist at multiple classification levels, the potential exists for inconsistent values for the same 
data item at different levels. Polyinstantiation may occur over tuples or elements, and it may arise 
through updates at low or high classification levels. Researchers have developed a number of 
different approaches to polyinstantiation; no one solution is best for all applications. This 
document has outlined approaches to resolving the polyinstantiation problem:

1.	Propagate polyinstantiated tuples to reflect valid combinations of values (Section 4.2). 
Users at different levels may see different attribute values for the same realworld entity.

2.	Identify derived tuples based on underlying polyinstantiated tuples (Section 4.3). 
Although a multilevel relation may have several tuples for the same real-world entity, there 
will only be one such tuple per classification level.

3.	Indicate restrictions or inconsistencies present in the data so that polyinstantiation can be 
controlled (Section 4.4). Users are made aware that data are restricted to certain levels, and 
are cognizant of the levels of data that they can see and update.

There are no explicitly stated TCSEC requirements for automatic or intentional polyinstantiation 
mechanisms. Evaluators will require that a vendor of an MLS DBMS address in some manner the 
signaling channels which polyinstantiation prevents. Current commercial MLS DBMSs enforce 
tuple level polyinstantiation. With appropriate (possibly complex/inconvenient) database design, 
tuple level labeling can offer functionality comparable to research prototypes supporting element 
level labeling and polyinstantiation.
