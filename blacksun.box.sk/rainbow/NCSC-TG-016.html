<H2><A name="HDR 2 5">FOREWORD</A></H2><I>Guidelines for Writing Trusted 
Facility Manuals</I> provides a set of good practices related to the 
documentation of trusted facility management functions of systems employed for 
processing classified and other sensitive information. A <I>Trusted Facility 
Manual (TFM)</I> is a document written by a system vendor that describes how to 
configure and install a specific secure system, operate the system in a secure 
manner, and make effective use of the system privileges and protection 
mechanisms to control access to administrative functions and databases.
<P><I>Guidelines for Writing Trusted Facility Manuals</I> is the latest addition 
to the "Rainbow Series" of documents. These publications are the product of the 
Technical Guidelines Program. The National Computer Security Center designed 
these technical guidelines to provide insight to the <I>Trusted Computer System 
Evaluation Criteria</I> requirements and guidance for meeting each requirement.
<P>Recommendations for revision to this guideline are encouraged and will be 
reviewed by the National Computer Security Center through a formal review 
process.

Center wishes to extend special recognition and acknowledgement for their 
contributions to this document to Infosystems Technology, Inc., and to Dr. 
Virgil D. Gligor of the University of Maryland as primary author and preparer of 
this document. Special thanks also go to the many computer vendor 
representatives, and members of the National Computer Security Center (NCSC) 
community who enthusiastically gave of their time and technical expertise in 
reviewing the material and providing valuable comments and suggestions.
<P>Special recognition goes to Leon Neufeld, NCSC, who served as project manager 
for the preparation and production of this document.
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR 2 6">PREFACE</A></H2>Throughout this guideline there will be 
recommendations made that are not included in the <I>Trusted Computer System 
Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)</I> as requirements. Any recommendations that are 
not in the <I>TCSEC</I> are prefaced by the word "should," whereas all 
requirements are prefaced by the word "shall." It is hoped that this will help 
to avoid any confusion.
<P>Examples in this document are not to be construed as the only implementation 
that will satisfy the <I>TCSEC</I> requirement. The examples and literature 
citations provided herein are merely suggestions of appropriate designs and, 
possibly, implementations. The recommendations in this document are also not to 
be construed as supplementary requirements to the TCSEC. The TCSEC is the only 
metric against which systems are to be evaluated.
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR1   2 6">1 INTRODUCTION</A></H2>The Department of Defense 
Computer Security Center (DoDCSC), established in January 1981, expands on the 
work started by the DoD Security Initiative. In 1985, the DoDCSC became the 
National Computer Security Center (NCSC) to reflect its responsibility for 
computer security throughout the Federal Government. The Director, NCSC, has the 
responsibility for establishing and publishing criteria and guidelines for all 
areas of computer security.
<P>The principal goal of the NCSC is to encourage the widespread availability of 
trusted computer systems. In support of that goal, the NCSC created a metric, 
known as the <I>DoD Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)</I>, 
against which computer systems could be evaluated for security. The DoDCSC 
originally published the TCSEC on 15 August 1983 as CSC-STD-001-83. In December 
1985, the DoD adopted it, with a few changes, as a DoD Standard, DoD 
5200.28-STD. DoD Directive 5200.28, Security Requirements for Automated 
Information Systems (AIS) requires the TCSEC to be used throughout the DoD. The 
TCSEC is the standard used for evaluating the effectiveness of security controls 
built into Automated Data Processing (ADP) systems. The TCSEC has four 
divisions: D, C, B, and A, ordered in a hierarchical manner with the highest 
division (A) being reserved for systems providing the best available level of 
assurance. Within divisions C, B, and A, a number of subdivisions, known as 
classes, are also ordered in a hierarchical manner to represent different levels 
of assurance in these classes.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR1.1   3 7">1.1 Purpose</A></H3>A Trusted Facility Manual (TFM) 
is one of the documents necessary to satisfy the requirements of any class in 
the <I>TCSEC</I>. The TFM is directed towards the administrators of an 
installation, and its goal is to provide detailed, accurate information on how 
to (1) configure and install a specific secure system, (2) operate the system in 
a secure manner, (3) make effective use of the system privileges and protection 
mechanisms to control access to administrative functions and databases, and (4) 
avoid pitfalls and improper use of the administrative functions that would 
compromise the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and user security.
<P>The importance of the TFM in supporting the operation of a secure computer 
system cannot be over estimated. Even if one assumes, hypothetically, that all 
users of a system and their applications are trusted, and that they will use all 
of the available protection mechanisms correctly, the system may still be 
administered and operated in an insecure manner. This may be especially true 
when administrative users lack the skill, the care, or the interest to use the 
system properly. Furthermore, the security damage that administrative users can 
cause by careless use, or deliberate misuse, of administrative authority is 
significantly larger than that caused by ordinary users. Although use of a 
detailed, accurate TFM cannot address or counter deliberate misuse of 
administrative authority, it can help minimize chances of misuse due to lack of 
awareness of proper system use. To help minimize these instances of system 
misuse, the TFM should include examples of both proper uses and warnings about 
consequences of misuse of administrative functions, procedures, privileges, and 
databases.
<P>This guideline presents the issues involved in writing TFMs. Its objectives 
are (1) to provide guidance to manufacturers on how to document functions of 
trusted facility management implemented by their systems and (2) recommend a TFM 
structure, format, and content that would satisfy the <I>TCSEC</I> requirements. 
The recommendations made herein should not be considered as the-only means to 
satisfy the TCSEC requirements. Additionally, this document contains suggestions 
and recommendations derived from the TCSEC objectives but which are not required 
by TCSEC in the TFM area. For example, the TFM may include documentation 
required by the TCSEC in the areas of System Architecture, Design Documentation, 
and Trusted Distribution. The inclusion of this documentation in a TFM instead 
of other separate documents is optional.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR1.2   3 7">1.2 Scope and Contents</A></H3>The TFM should give 
specific guidance to administrative users on how to configure, install, and 
operate a secure computer system, and should clearly illustrate the intended use 
of all security features, citing actual system commands and procedures. Although 
a high level of detail in illustrating key security concepts would benefit 
administrative users, the TFM cannot be considered to be, nor can it be, a 
training manual in the area of computer security in general, nor in the area of 
system administration in particular. Instead, the TFM user is assumed to have 
some familiarity with the notion of trusted systems within the realm of computer 
security. The TFM will provide the user with detailed information on how to 
administer and operate a specific trusted system in a secure manner.
<P>Many different organizations of the TFM are possible. For example, an 
acceptable TFM format would provide a separate section describing specific 
security responsibilities of any separate administrative roles, such as those of 
the security administrator, auditor, system programmer, operator, that are 
supported in the system; available commands for each role; use of each command; 
parameter and default settings; specific warnings and advice regarding the use 
of functions, privileges and databases of that role; and the specific 
responsibilities of that role for TCB security. Use of this format is advisable 
for manuals of systems in higher security classes, namely B2, B3, and A1, where 
separation of administrative roles is required.
<P>An equally acceptable TFM organization and section format would provide a 
separate section for each functional requirement area of the <I>TCSEC</I>, 
namely, for security policy (e.g., Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Mandatory 
Access Control, (MAC)), accountability, and TCB protection. Each section would 
include available commands, system calls, and procedures relevant to that area; 
use of each command (including the effects of each command when used by 
different administrative roles); parameter and default settings; and specific 
warnings and advice regarding the use of functions, privileges, and databases 
available to commands of that area. Use of this alternate format is advisable 
for lower security classes, namely C1-B1, where the TCSEC does not mandate any 
separation of administrative roles. Either of the two alternate TFM formats 
mentioned above is equally acceptable for all TCSEC security classes as long as 
the TFM satisfies the TCSEC requirements Furthermore, other TFM formats would 
also be acceptable as long as they satisfy the stated TCSEC requirements. The 
TCSEC neither requires nor suggests a specific TFM format.
<P>This guideline contains eight additional sections. Section 2 defines the 
security and accountability policies and mechanisms of systems. Section 3 
identifies and explains the security-relevant and security-irrelevant functions 
of an administrator. Section 4 identifies and explains the use of TCB commands 
and interfaces used by administrative users. Section 5 defines day-to-day 
routine operations performed by administrative users and the security 
vulnerabilities of these operations. Section 6 identifies all TCB security and 
integrity responsibilities of administrative users.
<P>Section 7 presents recommendations for writing the TFM that satisfy the 
requirements of the <I>TCSEC</I>. Section 8 is a glossary. Section 9 lists the 
references cited in the text. Each section consists of three parts: a statement 
of purpose, an explanation of how that purpose can be achieved, and an outline 
summarizing the recommendations made.
<P>These guidelines apply to computer systems and products built or modified 
with the intention of satisfying the <I>TCSEC</I> requirements.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR1.3   3 9">1.3 Control Objectives</A></H3>The control objectives 
for the TFM are similar to those of other documentation areas of the 
<I>TCSEC</I>. They refer to what should be documented in a particular area, such 
as the trusted facility management, and how this documentation should be 
structured. Thus, the control objectives for writing the TFM are:
<P>
<DL>
  <DD>(1) the TFM shall address all the requirements specified by the 
  <I>TCSEC</I> that are relevant to it; and<BR>
  <DD>(2) the TFM shall provide detailed, accurate information on how to:<BR>
  <DL>
    <DD>- configure and install a specific secure system;<BR>
    <DD>- operate a system in a secure manner;<BR>
    <DD>- avoid pitfalls and improper use of administrative functions that would 
    compromise system and user security.<BR></DD></DL></DD></DL>
<H3><A name="HDR1.4   3 9">1.4 TFM Introduction</A></H3>The purpose of this 
section in the TFM is to explain the scope, use, and contents of the TFM of a 
particular system. In general, the scope of the TFM should include explanations 
of how to configure and maintain secure systems, administer and operate them in 
a secure manner, make effective use of the system's privileges and protection 
mechanisms for administrative use, and avoid pitfalls and misuse of 
administrative authority. Depending on the particular computer system, the 
complexity of trusted facility management may differ and thus the scope of the 
TFM may differ accordingly. For example, in large systems, system configuration 
and installation is a complex activity described in a separate system 
administration manual that may, or may not, include the other important areas of 
the TFM. In contrast, system configuration and installation is a relatively 
simple activity defined in a single chapter of a TFM for a small system, such as 
a multi-user workstation.
<P>The introduction to the TFM should also discuss the recommended use of the 
manual. In particular, this section should define the skills and general 
computer systems and security background assumed for administrative personnel. 
This is necessary because different administrative functions require different 
levels of skill. For example, an individual in the system programming staff that 
configures, installs, and maintains the TCB code often needs considerably more 
technical skills than an individual in the accounts management staff. Similarly, 
a security administrator needs more detailed knowledge of the system security 
policy and accountability than individuals assigned to operator's roles. The 
definition of required skills and background is important in aiding the 
management of a particular organization in assigning appropriately trained 
individuals to various administrative tasks.
<P>In defining the use of the TFM, the introductory section should also include 
a list of other system manuals that may be consulted by the administrative 
staff. For example, most administrators may benefit from an understanding of the 
Security Features User's Guide (SFUG). Most system designs use the DAC 
mechanisms described in the SFUG for protection of, at least, some 
administrative files, and may use the trusted path mechanism to prevent spoofing 
of administrative commands. Similarly, whenever manual sections that logically 
belong in the TFM are in fact provided in other manuals --- system configuration 
and installation manuals, and system reference manuals containing descriptive 
top-level specifications (DTLSs) of commands and interfaces used by 
administrative users---the TFM Introduction should include references to these 
additional manuals. The TFM should place the references to these manuals in 
context and provide a brief synopsis of the relevant information from the 
specific manual citation. This citation would help narrow the reader's focus to 
a few pages of the referenced manual. Furthermore, references to documents, 
manuals, and standards that may be beneficial to some administrative personnel, 
such as password management and use guidelines and standards, should be made in 
this section. References to educational and training documents that are helpful 
to administrative personnel may also be included here.
<P>The TFM writer may also want to define the limitations of the TFM in terms of 
security scope. For example, some security issues such as personnel background 
verification, assignment and maintenance of users' trust levels, physical system 
and environmental security, proper use of cryptographic techniques and devices, 
and procedures that assign individuals to administrative roles, generally fall 
outside the scope of TFM definition. Explicit recognition of such limitations 
enables the management of a secure facility to plan countermeasures for areas of 
vulnerability not countered by the trusted systems.
<P>Finally, the introductory section of the TFM should include a "road map" 
defining the contents of each TFM section and possibly the relationships between 
various manual sections. This road map may also identify the self-contained 
sections of the manual that can be read independently of other sections.
<P>In summary, the introductory section of the TFM should include:

<H2><A name="HDR2   2 11">2 SYSTEM SECURITY OVERVIEW</A></H2>The purpose of this 
section of the TFM is to define the security and accountability policies and 
mechanisms of the system that are designed to counter a set of perceived 
threats. The focus of this section should be on the administrative-user 
functions available to counter threats, the privileges and protection mechanisms 
available to administrative users, and the general vulnerabilities associated 
with actions of administrative users. This section should also include a list of 
dependencies on other security measures, such as those for the maintenance of 
physical security, which, although not required by the TCSEC, should be taken 
into account by the management of the system installation and by system 
accreditors.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR2.1   3 11">2.1 Threats</A></H3>Examples of the general security 
threat handled by systems built to satisfy a <I>TCSEC</I> class is that of 
unauthorized disclosure of information through either unauthorized direct or 
indirect access to system and user objects through system failures, subversion, 
and TCB tampering or through use of covert channels. The manual should describe 
some of the common attacks that cause unauthorized disclosure of information, in 
the context of the specific system. These examples might include the use of 
Trojan horses in untrusted shared programs, the use of covert channels by 
untrusted users and applications, the use of known penetration methods that 
cause unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or proprietary information, and the 
misuse of access authorization to retrieve and disclose sensitive information 
(e.g., insider attacks).
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR2.2   3 11">2.2 Countermeasures Based on Security and 
Accountability Policies and Procedures</A></H3>This section of the TFM should 
include a brief discussion of the protection mechanisms available in the system 
that help counter the threats defined in the above section. This discussion 
should serve as a summary of the protection philosophy used in the design and 
implementation of the protection mechanisms and should include a presentation of 
the role of security policy (both discretionary and mandatory policy, if any), 
accountability, and assurance (both operational and life-cycle assurance). The 
dependency of the system security mechanisms on administrative-user actions 
should be emphasized here.
<P>This section should point out clearly the types of threats that can, or 
cannot, be countered by a specific policy or mechanism. For example, this 
section should state that DAC mechanisms cannot, and are not meant to, prevent 
or contain threats posed by Trojan horses implementing time bombs, trap doors, 
or viruses placed in shared, untrusted applications [2]. DAC mechanisms cannot, 
nor are they meant to, detect or prevent access performed by an authorized 
subject on behalf of an unauthorized subject (e.g., the surrogate access problem 
[3]). Furthermore, DAC mechanisms are not, nor were they ever claimed to be, 
capable of controlling information (as opposed to access privilege) flows. Only 
MAC can handle these problems.
<P>This section should discuss, in the context of the specific system, the role 
of specific accountability mechanisms and policies in countering security 
threats not handled by access control mechanisms. An example is the use of audit 
mechanisms to complement access control mechanisms in the sense that they can 
detect attacks initiated by <I>authorized</I> users (i.e., by "insiders"), or 
that trusted-path mechanisms are required to prevent spoofing, a threat not 
usually countered by access control mechanisms or policies.
<P>The emphasis in describing the above-mentioned threats and countermeasures 
should be on the identification of the TCB mechanisms and policies that counter 
a specific threat. For example, the summary of the countermeasures supported by 
the system should include the basic assertion (and in other design documents, 
the justification) that the TCB itself is non-circumventable and tamper proof. 
Additional points of emphasis may be that all countermeasures supported in the 
system require the interaction of both access control and accountability 
mechanisms, and that these mechanisms should be employed by both ordinary and 
administrative users. This section should provide examples of interaction 
between ordinary and administrative user decisions to illustrate both the 
positive and negative consequences of such interaction.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR2.3   3 12">2.3 Explicit Physical Security 
Assumptions</A></H3>The <I>TCSEC</I> does not include requirements for physical 
security of the system installation. However, the TFM should include a section 
or a subsection that states the physical security assumptions made by the system 
designers. These assumptions should be satisfied by the management of the 
organization responsible for deploying the system, as the evaluation of physical 
security is the responsibility of the system's accreditors.
<P>The explicit inclusion of the physical security assumptions made by designers 
in the TFM will provide the accreditors with the necessary input for the 
deployment of the system in different operational environments and provide the 
administrative users an important input for the sound definition of the system 
security profile. For example, systems that do not provide trusted paths for 
administrative users usually assume that a set of terminal ports is reserved for 
the connection of administrative consoles that are physically separated from the 
rest of the user terminals for the entire lifetime of the system. Also, a common 
assumption is that the system definition of the security profile ensures that 
the level of trust associated with the physical environment containing a 
system's peripheral will always dominate the maximum sensitivity associated with 
that peripheral. Similarly, this section should emphasize that systems allowing 
legitimate users to access their components (e.g., removable media) should be 
used only in environments where both administrative and ordinary users are 
trusted to access all data in the system and are trusted not to misuse their 
physical access permissions. (In such environments, the use of untrusted 
applications may still require the use of trusted systems even though all users 
are trusted to access all data.) In systems that do not allow users to access 
the system components, or when the above level of user trust cannot be 
guaranteed, the TFM should suggest the physical controls necessary to counter, 
or deter, the potential threat of physical access to system components. The 
presentation of the physical security assumptions made by system designers 
should enable accreditors to determine the security risks and exposures assumed 
by system use as well as the required countermeasures.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR2.4   3 13">2.4 Protection Mechanisms Available to 
Administrative Users</A></H3>The security of any system depends directly on the 
security of the administrative commands, interfaces, and databases. For this 
reason, administrative commands, privileges, and databases shall be protected 
from ordinary users, and in some <I>TCSEC</I> security classes, shall be 
separated on a role basis. This section should identify the protection 
mechanisms available to administrative users to ensure that these users are 
aware of the means available to control access to their commands, privileges, 
and databases.
<P>All protection mechanisms that can be manipulated by ordinary users are also 
usually available to administrative users. For example, all user identification 
and authentication, and DAC mechanisms are available to administrative users. In 
addition to mentioning these mechanisms, which the SFUG already defines, this 
TFM section should include the description of the mechanisms available only to 
the administrative users and the mode of their safe use. For example, the use of 
special trusted-path mechanisms based on physically protected, hard-wired 
consoles, which may allow the invocation of command processors available only to 
administrative users, and the use of audit mechanisms to detect potential 
intrusion by authorized users, are only a few of the protection mechanisms 
specific to administrative users [7].
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR2.5   3 13">2.5 Security Vulnerabilities and 
Warnings</A></H3>This section should describe the security vulnerabilities of 
administrative commands and procedures, and should suggest specific ways to 
counter them. Reference [7] cites generic examples of common vulnerabilities of 
administrative roles and role-specific vulnerabilities. In addition to similar 
examples, this TFM section should include a discussion of system-specific 
vulnerabilities and countermeasures required in the assumed environments of 
system use.
<P>In any system, design and implementation assumptions are made about 
administrative actions and their sequence of use. For example, the loading of a 
system during the installation phase, and the installation itself, may require 
the use of special administrative commands in a specific sequence. The 
definition of a user security profile may require that administrators do not 
reuse user and group identifiers, and that the definition of the system security 
profile prohibits the reuse of bit encodings of sensitivity levels without 
careful analysis of consequences. Other potential vulnerabilities, such as those 
resulting from mismanagement of audit logs and post processing of files (in 
on-line, off-line, and hard-copy form) should also be explained here. Design and 
implementation assumptions should be stated explicitly in this section to ensure 
that administrative users are aware of the negative consequences of not 
satisfying these assumptions.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR2.6   3 14">2.6 Separation of Administrative 
Roles</A></H3>Security classes B2-A1 of the <I>TCSEC</I> require that the roles 
of the administrative users be separated. This requirement means that the 
commands, procedures, privileges, and databases of the various administrative 
roles shall be separated by system design and shall be documented as such. Role 
separation of classes B3 and A1 also requires the separation of 
security-relevant functions from the security irrelevant ones. Reference [7] 
cites the rationale and the means of achieving role separation in trusted 
systems.
<P>The TFM shall define each separate role supported by the system. Each role 
should be clearly defined in terms of the commands and TCB interfaces available 
to the role, the use of each command, the command effects and exceptions 
(whenever these are not defined in the DTLS of the TCB), parameter and default 
settings, specific warnings for the command use, and advice. The TFM should also 
define the specific security mechanisms used to protect privileged commands and 
data used by administrators.
<P>In summary, the TFM section presenting the system security overview for 
administrative users should include the following subsections:
<P>
<DL>
  <DD>2.1 Threats to System Security<BR>
  <DD>2.2 Countermeasures Based on Security Policy and Accountability<BR>
  <DD>2.3 Explicit Physical Security Assumptions<BR>
  <DD>2.4 Protection Mechanisms Available to Administrative Users<BR>
  <DD>2.5 Security Vulnerabilities of Administrative Users and Warnings<BR>
  <DD>2.6 Separation of Administrative Roles (for classes B2-A1)<BR></DD></DL>
<H2><A name="HDR3   2 14">3 SECURITY POLICY</A></H2>The purpose of this section 
is to identify and explain the security-relevant and security-irrelevant 
functions of the administrators. In particular, this section should explain, in 
the area of security-relevant functions, the use of the TCB commands and 
interfaces by administrative users to initialize discretionary access 
privileges, to set default user accesses to system objects after user 
registration, and to distribute, review, and revoke access privileges on behalf 
of users in systems that implement DAC in a centralized way (2]. In systems that 
support MAC, this section also identifies and explains the use of TCB commands 
and interfaces by administrators to define and change the system security 
profile (e.g., the system-sensitivity map, sensitivity level limits for system 
devices, and file systems), to define and change object sensitivity levels 
(e.g., label imported, unlabeled data, and media), and to change the trust level 
of active subjects, whenever such a function is supported. This section also 
should define the administrator's interfaces for other functions related to the 
support of DAC and MAC, such as changing object ownership, restoring privileges 
deleted accidentally, destroying errant processes, running consistency checks on 
system and user security profiles, and managing user accounts.
<P>Reference [7] outlines the role of the security administrators in support of 
the security policy defined in a system. The TFM should specify the commands, 
system calls, functions, their parameters and default settings provided for each 
area of security policy and support, and should provide examples of use, 
potential misuse, and security implications of command misuse. For example, the 
TFM should explain how the administrator can change the sensitivity label of an 
object or a subject, and cite the expected security consequences Of such action 
and also how the administrator may determine the consequences of such a change 
in the given system. Similarly, the administrator may decide to reuse a binary 
representation of a sensitivity level to define a new sensitivity level. For 
this process, the manual shall state the circumstances in which this change is 
allowed, if ever, and should explain the conditions under which this change is 
safe. All commands, system calls, and functions should be defined in terms of 
their effects, exceptions, and parameters. The use of commands should be 
illustrated by examples showing the correct settings of various command options. 
This section should describe the recommended reactions of the administrator to 
such exceptions (unless these reactions are already described in the 
call/command DTLS).
<P>The administrative functions and interfaces used in supporting the security 
policy have potential vulnerabilities. Reference [7] outlines some of these 
generic vulnerabilities. The TFM shall include warnings of all known specific 
vulnerabilities in the given system and possibly suggest means of reducing 
system risk associated with such vulnerabilities. Minimally, the TFM should 
specify the dependencies of the administrative roles on external policies and 
procedures that would help reduce system risk associated with identified 
vulnerabilities.
<P>In summary, the security policy section of the TFM should include the 
following subsections (whose contents are discussed in more detail in reference 
[7]):
<P>
<DL>
  <DD>3.1 Discretionary Access Control<BR>
  <DL>
    <DD>-TCB commands and interfaces used to initialize DAC privileges and 
    defaults;<BR>
    <DD>-TCB command interfaces to distribute, review, and revoke user

  Activities Related to Security Policy.<BR></DD></DL>
<H2><A name="HDR4   2 16">4 ACCOUNTABILITY</A></H2>
<H3><A name="HDR4.1   3 16">4.1 Identification and Authentication Functions of 
Administrative Users</A></H3>The purpose of this section is to identify and 
explain the use of TCB commands and interfaces that should be used by 
administrative users to set up user security profiles, and to determine 
authentication and authorization parameters associated with the user 
identification and authentication mechanism. Reference [7] defines the role of 
the security administrator in the identification and authentication area. The 
TFM shall specify the commands, system calls and functions, and their parameters 
and default settings that are provided by the specific system, and should 
provide examples of the use, or potential misuse of these commands, and the 
security implications of command misuse. For example, the TFM should explain how 
the administrator can initialize user passwords, can distribute special 
passwords to other administrative users, and set up account restrictions (e.g., 
restricted time intervals for login, account cutoff). The commands that allow 
the definition of user and group identifiers shall include an explanation of how 
these identifiers should be chosen, why they should not be reused, and what the 
consequences of identifier reuse are.
<P>In most systems, the setting of the user security profile also includes the 
definition of some discretionary privileges associated with the user account. 
For example, in systems that use groups to enforce DAC policies, administrators 
define the group membership. The TFM shall explain the consequences of adding or 
deleting a user identity to a group in terms of the added or lost discretionary 
privileges, and provide appropriate warnings. In systems where the user security 
profile also includes the specification of the maximum level of trust for each 
user, the TFM shall also discuss the security implications of incorrect 
definition or change of these levels and the interactions between these levels 
and the sensitivity levels of various system components (defined in the system 
security profile). It should also include examples of and warnings about such 
changes. The commands available to system administrators also include those to 
define and change the parameters of the login/logout mechanism used by a system. 
Consequently, the TFM should explain how to define these parameters, which 
include the time-out period, multiple login attributes, maximum Iogin time, and 
limits on unsuccessful logins from a terminal or into an account [7] (e.g., 
specific commands, command options, formats, parameter ranges, and default 
values). Whenever the trusted path mechanisms available to administrative users 
require special procedures, such as use of specific hard-wired consoles, the TFM 
shall specify how the administrative users can use the trusted path mechanism in 
a secure manner. 
<P>The TFM shall also explain the implications of the system security profile 
definition in providing authorization data for user log ins. For example, a 
terminal's maximum and minimum sensitivity levels provide cutoff values for 
whether a certain user login level can be used and whether a certain user with a 
given user and group level clearance can log in at all from a given terminal. 
The relationship between the terminals minimum and maximum sensitivity levels 
and the user's clearance level shall be explained so that consistent levels can 
be defined for both terminal sensitivity and user level of trust. 
<P>Finally, administrator commands for temporarily terminating a user access to 
the system and for permanently deleting the user account shall be defined, and 
the implications of such actions defined. This section should also include 
warnings about potential vulnerabilities, such as object ownership set to the 
identity of an user or account that is no longer valid, or the reuse of an old 
identifier, that persist when a user account is not deleted correctly or 
completely, and examples of such vulnerabilities [7].
<P>For all administrative commands defined in this and other system security 
areas, this TFM section should include an explanation of all exceptions and, 
possibly, a administrator's recommended response to these exceptions. (This 
reaction may already be described in the system call/command DTLS). All 
administrative data bases that are accessed by these commands should be 
identified showing how they are, or can be, protected. All mechanisms available 
for the protection of the identification and authentication data shall be 
clearly explained. The use of these mechanisms should be illustrated by 
examples.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.2   3 17">4.2 Audit</A></H3>The purpose of this section of the 
TFM is to familiarize administrative users with the TCB commands and interfaces 
of the system's audit mechanism. These commands include those that enable or 
disable the audit selectivity mechanism (e.g., audit-event setup and change), 
those that help manage the audit trails (logs), those that perform data 
compression and post processing analysis, and in classes B2---A1, those that set 
correct channel delays and randomize variables.
<P>Some system includes a set of audit events that should always be selected for 
audit to ensure the consistency of subsequent events selected by the auditor and 
the proper functioning of the post processing tools. These events should be 
explicitly highlighted for special discussion in the list of auditable events 
supported by the system. The complete list of events shall be defined in the 
TFM. The audit selection mechanism should also be presented, and examples of use 
should be provided. Commands of the audit selectivity mechanism include those 
that turn on and off events on a per-user, per-process, per-terminal, 
per-sensitivity-level, or per-object basis. In <I>TCSEC</I> classes B3 and A1, 
the commands that turn on and off events representing accumulations of other 
auditable events and audit-system alarms (if any) shall also be presented.
<P>Systems that support audit mechanisms include commands that help manage the 
audit files. These commands, which include those to create new and destroy old 
audit logs, to change audit log size and warning points, to display, format, and 
compress audit data, and to check the consistency of the audit database after 
crashes, and when these changes take effect, shall also be included in the TFM. 
The procedures that shall be used by auditors to ensure that the audit files do 
not overflow shall also be presented. The format in the audit log file of each 
record field and of each type of auditable event shall be presented and 
explained. Commands for post processing of audit logs (if any) shall also be 
included in the TFM. Systems designed to satisfy the B2---A1 security 
requirements need to have covert channels restricted to certain limits. One 
means of reducing covert channel bandwidths is by placement of delays and by 
setting of randomization variables in system kernels and trusted processes. 
Commands that accomplish this task should be presented in the TFM of these 
systems along with a description of the covert channel handling policy 
recommended for enforcement. These recommendations should be derived from the 
covert-channel analysis guideline of the <I>TCSEC</I> and are important because 
they affect not only the security policy and the accountability areas of the 
system, but also system performance. Reference [7] defines the administrative 
functions necessary to support audit activities. As suggested in the covert 
channel guidelines of the TCSEC, bandwidth reduction policy should be 
coordinated with audit policy. For this reason, the TFM should present the 
bandwidth reduction policy in the same section with that presenting the audit 
policy.
<P>Recommendations on audit procedures should also be included in the TFM. These 
procedures would suggest auditing groups of specific events that may reveal 
misuse of access privileges, potential system-penetration attacks, and covert 
channel usage. They may also suggest the frequency of audit review and provide 
advice on how to manage audit files on-line and off-line.
<P>For commands used by administrative users for audit, the TFM should include a 
description of their effects and exceptions, and should provide examples of use, 
potential misuse, and security implications of command misuses. Recommendations 
for administrator's reactions to command exceptions should also be made. 
Reference [7] provides examples of vulnerabilities caused by misuse of audit 
command and authority. These examples include loss of audit log consistency, 
loss of audit logs, loss of user privacy, and various forms of denial of 
service. Specific instances of vulnerability in a given system and possible 
suggestions for reducing the system's exposure to such vulnerabilities should 
also be included in the audit section of the TFM.
<P>In summary, the accountability section of the TFM should include the 
following subsections:

  <DD>4.5 Warnings of Specific Security Vulnerabilities of Administrative 
  Activities and Procedures Related to Identification, Authentication, Trusted 
  Path and Audit<BR></DD></DL>
<H2><A name="HDR5   2 19">5 ROUTINE OPERATIONS</A></H2>The purpose of this 
section of the TFM is to define the routine operations performed by 
administrative users, describe the operation's security, describe the 
vulnerabilites associated with these operations, and provide appropriate 
warnings. These operations are carried out, in most cases, by execution of 
appropriate commands from a system console. However, in some instances, these 
operations involve manipulation of physical devices, such as printers, storage 
devices, removable media, communication switches, and modems. For this reason, 
this TFM section may differ from the rest of the TFM. It should contain not only 
definitions of specific commands and TCB interfaces, but also procedures and 
policies for secure use and manipulation of hardware devices.
<P>Routine operations of administrative personnel include both security-relevant 
and security-irrelevant operations. Security-relevant functions include those 
that boot and shut down the system, set system clocks, identify damaged user 
volumes and files, perform TCB backups and on-line device tests, run system 
integrity tests, and respond to user requests to mount/unmount volumes. Routine 
security- irrelevant operations include those that perform system metering, and 
that require operator response to various user requests [7]
<P>This section the TFM should include a description of each command used for 
routine operations, including its effects and exceptions, and should provide 
examples of use, potential misuse, and security implications of command misuse. 
Examples of vulnerabilities of security-relevant, routine operations include the 
booting of an old version of the TCB, causing inconsistency problems for users; 
system shutdown while still in normal operation causing loss of files and file 
system inconsistencies; and inadequate use of devices and device interfaces 
(e.g., printers). 
<P>This section the TFM should also include descriptions of administrative 
commands that perform security-irrelevant routine operations. These commands 
include those traditionally performed by account administrators, such as 
commands used for maintenance of accounting files, for turning on and off 
accounting, for running accounting tools, for collecting statistics of system 
and resource usage, and billing information.
<P>Administrative policies and procedures that define security-relevant handling 
of devices shall also be included in the TFM. For example, procedures to 
install, activate, and set the current sensitivity level of a printer within the 
pre-defined range should be defined, and examples of the installation procedure 
should be given. In summary, the TFM section defining the routine administrative

<H2><A name="HDR6   2 21">6 SECURITY OF THE TCB</A></H2>The two purposes of this 
TFM section are to identify and explain all aspects of TCB security and 
integrity that become the responsibility of administrative users. Because the 
security of all user programs, data, and application subsystems is provided by 
the TCB, the maintenance of TCB security and integrity is one of the most 
sensitive administrative functions.
<P>Maintenance of TCB security spans the entire system life cycle. It includes 
procedures for strict configuration management during system development and 
use, and for secure system distribution, installation, and local maintenance. In 
some cases, administrative users are allowed and required to generate another 
evaluated version of the TCB from source code (e.g., make changes to the TCB 
source code and regenerate the TCB on site). In such cases, the TFM shall 
include detailed descriptions of procedures that generate a new TCB version from 
source code, the necessary system commands, the list of approved tools (e.g., 
compilers, linkers, loaders) for TCB generation, examples of command use, 
warnings of possible problems in generating a new TCB, vulnerabilities that may 
affect TCB security, and configuration management.
<P>The TFM shall also provide, or reference a separate document that provides, a 
description of command exceptions, appropriate warnings, and possible exception 
handling advice. The TFM should also provide, or reference a separate document 
that describes, the configuration management tools. The TFM shall include 
descriptions of the procedures that must be followed by site administrators to 
install new releases of the TCB.
<P>TCB security may be violated during installation and maintenance (see [7]). 
For this reason, the TFM shall provide a description of the TCB installation 
procedures, including the required commands, exceptions, parameter settings, 
required system configuration, warnings, and advice. The installation procedures 
should contain descriptions of the TCB data structures that must be initialized 
by the user, and of the TCB loading. Also, the installation procedures should 
include a list of tools (e.g., editors, loaders) approved for TCB installation 
and an appropriate description of secure installation assumptions (e.g., 
administrative procedures, such as those that require physical audit of the 
installation procedure by independent personnel).
<P>All TCB maintenance procedures shall be defined in the TFM. These procedures 
should include analyzing system "dumps" after crashes, conducting crash-recovery 
and restart actions, performing consistency checking of TCB files and 
directories, changing system configuration parameters (e.g., table sizes, 
devices, and device drivers), running periodic system integrity checks, and 
repairing damaged labels. A list of the approved tools for TCB maintenance, 
relevant commands, exceptions, warnings, and advice should also be included in 
this section.
<P>The ability to install and maintain a system's TCB in a secure manner 
requires that administrative users be cognizant of all TCB modules. 
Administrators should especially be cognizant of those hardware modules 
containing the reference monitor mechanism, and of all the of default file 
protections for TCB files or objects. If available, the command needed to run a 
tool that checks the correct privilege and sensitivity-level initialization for 
TCB files or objects shall be identified and its use illustrated. Thus, either 
the TFM itself shall provide a list of all TCB modules, including their 
interfaces, and shall specify the TCB file or object privileges necessary to 
protect the TCB or the TFM shall list a separate document that does.
<P>The TFM shall include warnings and advice on how to handle both generic and 
system-specific vulnerabilities (if any) of TCB installation and maintenance. 
For example, administrative users should be warned that interchanges of 
dedicated- console and user-terminal communication lines can `cause potential 
loss of trusted path for administrative users, that placement of extraneous code 
in the TCB configuration may result from using an unapproved tool, and that 
running a borrowed untrusted program under administrative identity may cause an 
untold number of TCB security problems [7].
<P>Finally, the TFM shall include a description of policies and procedures that 
define the distribution procedures for a trusted system (i.e., a class A1 
requirement). These policies and procedures shall be used to maintain the 
integrity of the mapping between the master copy defining the current version of 
the TCB and the on-site installed copy.
<P>In summary, the TFM section that defines the security measures necessary for 
protection of the TCB should include the following subsections:

  trail 
  <DT>Authenticate -
  <DD>(1) To verify the identity of a user, device, or other entity in a 
  computer system, often as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in a

  any other subject. 
  <DT>Formal Security Policy Model - 
  <DD>A mathematically precise statement of a security policy. To be adequately 
  precise, such a model shall represent the initial state of a system, the way 
  in which the system progresses from one state to another, and a definition of 
  a "secure" state of the system. To be acceptable as a basis for a TCB, the 
  model shall be supported by a formal proof that if the initial state of the 
  system satisfies the definition of a "secure" state. If all assumptions 
  required by the model hold, then all future states of the system will be 
  secure. Some formal modeling techniques include state transition models, 
  temporal logic models, denotational semantics models, and algebraic 
  specification models. 
  <DT>Formal Top-Level Specification (FTLS) -

  <DT>Least Privilege - 
  <DD>The principle that requires that each subject in a system be granted the

  <DT>Mandatory Access Control - 
  <DD>A means of restricting access to objects based on the sensitivity (as 
  represented by a label) of the information contained in the objects and the

  such sensitivity. 
  <DT>Multilevel Device - 
  <DD>A device that is used in a manner that permits simultaneous processing of 
  data of two or more security levels without risk of compromise. To accomplish 
  this, sensitivity labels are normally stored on the same physical medium and 
  in the same form (i.e., machine-readable or human-readable) as the data being 
  processed. 
  <DT>Multilevel Secure - 
  <DD>A class of system containing information with different sensitivities 
  that, simultaneously permits access by users with different security 
  clearances and need-to-know, but prevents users from obtaining access to 
  information for which they lack authorization. 
  <DT>Object - 
  <DD>A passive entity that contains or receives information. Access to an 
  object potentially implies access to the information it contains. Examples of 
  objects are records, blocks, pages, segments, files, directories, directory

  access to the AIS (with the possible exception of the Auditor). 
  <DT>Security Level - 
  <DD>The combination of a hierarchical classification and a set of 
  non-hierarchical categories that represents the sensitivity of information. 
  <DT>Security Policy - 
  <DD>The set of laws, rules, and practices that regulate how an organization 
  manages, protects, and distributes sensitive information. 
  <DT>Security Policy Model - 
  <DD>A formal (informal.in the case of B1) presentation of the security policy 
  enforced by the system. It must identify the set of rules and practices that 
  regulate how a system manages, protects, and distributes sensitive 
  information. 
  <DT>Security-Relevant Event - 
  <DD>Any event that attempts to change the security state of the system (e.g., 
  change the DAC, change the security level of the subject, change user 
  password). Also, any event that attempts to violate the security policy of the 
  system, (e.g., too many attempts to log in, attempts to violate the MAC limits 
  of a device, attempts to downgrade a file). 
  <DT>Security Testing - 
  <DD>A process used to determine that the security features of a system are 
  implemented as designed and that they are adequate for a proposed application 
  environment. 
  <DT>Sensitive Information - 
  <DD>Any information, the loss, misuse, modification of, or unauthorized access 
  to, that could affect the national interest or the conduct of Federal 
  programs, or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under Section 552a 
  of Title 5, U.S. Code, but that has not been specifically authorized under 
  criteria established by an Executive order or act of Congress to be kept 
  classified in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. 
  <DT>Sensitivity Label - 
  <DD>A piece of information that represents the security level of an object and 
  that describes the sensitivity (e.g., classification) of the data in the 
  object. Sensitivity labels are used by the TCB as the basis for MAC decisions. 

  <DT>Subject - 
  <DD>An active entity, generally in the form of a person, process, or device 
  that causes information to flow among objects or changes in the system state. 
  Technically, a process/domain pair. 
  <DT>Subject Security Level - 
  <DD>A subject's security level that is equal to the security level of the 
  objects to which it has both read and write access. A subject's security level 
  shall always be dominated by the clearance of the user associated with the 
  subject. 
  <DT>System Programmer - 
  <DD>An administrative role or user responsible for the trusted system 
  distribution, configuration, installation, and non-routine maintenance. 
  <DT>System Security Map -

  level; typically, a functional specification that omits all implementation 
  details.

  system protection mechanisms to be circumvented. It is activated in some 
  innocent-appearing manner (e.g., special "random" key sequence at a terminal). 

  <DT>Trojan Horse - 
  <DD>A computer program with an apparently or actually useful function that 
  contains additional (hidden) functions that surreptitiously exploit the 
  legitimate authorizations of the invoking process to the detriment of 
  security; for example, making a "blind copy" of a sensitive file for the 
  creator of the Trojan horse. 
  <DT>Trusted Computer System - 
  <DD>A system that employs sufficient hardware and software assurance measures 
  to allow its use for simultaneous processing a range of sensitive or 
  classified information. 
  <DT>Trusted Computing Base (TCB) - 
  <DD>The totality of protection mechanisms within a computer system -`including 
  hardware, firmware, and software --- the combination of which is responsible 
  for enforcing a security policy. A TCB consists of one or more components that 
  together enforce a unified security policy over a product or system. The 
  ability of a TCB to enforce a security policy correctly depends solely on the 
  mechanisms within the TCB and on the correct input by system administrative 
  personnel of parameters (e.g., a user's clearance) related to the security 
  policy. 
  <DT>Trusted Path - 
  <DD>A mechanism by which a person at a terminal can communicate directly with

  <DD>Person or process accessing an AS either by direct connections (i.e., via 
  terminals), or indirect connections (i.e., prepare input data or receive 
  output that is not reviewed for content or classification by a responsible 
  individual). 
  <DT>Verification - 
  <DD>The process of comparing two levels of system specification for proper 
  correspondence (e.g., security policy model with top-level specification, TLS 
  with source code, or source code with object code). This process may or may 
  not be automated. 
  <DT>Write - 
  <DD>A fundamental operation that results only in the flow of information from 
  a subject to an object.
