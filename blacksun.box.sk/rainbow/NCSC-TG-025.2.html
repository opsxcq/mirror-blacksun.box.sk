<H2><A name="HDR 2 7">FOREWORD</A></H2>The National Computer Security Center is 
issuing <I>A Guide to Understanding Data Remanence in Automated Information 
Systems</I> as part of the "Rainbow Series" of documents our Technical 
Guidelines Program produces. In the Rainbow Series, we discuss in detail the 
features of the <I>Department of Defense Trusted Computer System Evaluation 
Criteria</I> (DoD 5200.28-STD) and provide guidance for meeting each 
requirement. The National Computer Security Center, through its Trusted Product 
Evaluation Program, evaluates the security features of commercially-produced 
computer systems. Together, these programs ensure that organizations are capable 
of protecting their important data with trusted computer systems. While data 
remanence is not a directly evaluated criterion of trusted computing systems, it 
is an issue critical to the safeguarding of information used by trusted 
computing systems.
<P><I>A Guide to Understanding Data Remanence in Automated Information 
Systems</I> is intended for use by personnel responsible for the secure handling 
of sensitive or classified automated information system memory and secondary 
storage media. It is important that they be aware of the retentive properties of 
such media, the known risks in attempting to erase and release it, and the 
approved security procedures that will help prevent disclosure of sensitive or 
classified information. This version supersedes CSC-STD-005-85, <I>Department of 
Defense Magnetic Remanence Security Guideline</I>, dated 15 November 1985.
<P>As the Director, National Computer Security Center, I invite your suggestions 
for revising this document. We plan to review this document as the need arises.

<H2><A name="HDR 2 8">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</A></H2>The National Computer Security 
Center extends recognition to Captain James K. Goldston, United States Air 
Force, for providing engineering support and as primary author and preparer of 
this guideline. We thank the many people involved in preparing this document. 
Their careful review and input were invaluable. The National Computer Security 
Center extends recognition to Dr. Bane W. Burnham and David N. Kreft, without 
whom this revision could not have taken place. Other reviewers that provided 
much needed input are Carole S. Jordan, Lawrence M. Sudduth, and Kim 
Johnson-Braun and George L. Cipra.
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR1   2 8">1 INTRODUCTION</A></H2>Data remanence is the residual 
physical representation of data that has been in some way erased. After storage 
media is erased there may be some physical characteristics that allow data to be 
reconstructed. This document discusses the role data remanence plays when 
storage media is erased for the purposes of reuse or release.
<P>Various documents have been published that detail procedures for clearing, 
purging, declassifying, or destroying automated information system (AIS) storage 
media. [1,2,4, 5, 6, 8,9,13 and 16] The Department of Defense (DoD) published 
DoD Directive 5200.28, <I>Security Requirements for Automated Information 
Systems</I>, [17] and its corresponding security manual DoD 5200.28-M, 
<I>Automated Data Processing Security Manual</I>, [1] in 1972 and 1973, 
respectively. These two documents were amended in 1979, in response to the 
Defense Science Board Task Force recommendation to establish uniform DoD policy 
for computer security requirements, controls, and measures. The directive was 
again revised in March 1988, and efforts are underway to revise the manual.
<P>DoD 5200.28-M addresses DoD requirements for the secure handling and disposal 
of memory and secondary storage media. While the Department of Defense requires 
the use of DoD Directive 5200.28 and DoD 5200.28-M by DoD components, the heads 
of DoD components may augment these requirements to meet their needs by 
prescribing more detailed guidelines and instructions provided they are 
consistent with these policies. DoD contractors and subcontractors who 
participate in the Defense Industrial Security Program (DISP) are required to 
comply with DoD 5220.22-M, <I>Industrial Security Manual for Safeguarding 
Classified Information</I>. [8] The Defense Investigative Service is responsible 
for the promulgation of the policy reflected in DoD 5220.22-M. Unlike these 
policy documents, <I>A Guide To Understanding Data Remanence In Automated 
Information Systems</I> does not provide requirements.
<P>Sometime during the life cycle of an AIS, its primary and secondary storage 
may need to be reused, declassified, destroyed, or released. It is important 
that security officers, computer operators, and other users or guardians of AS 
resources be informed of the risks involving the reuse, declassification, 
destruction, and release of AIS storage media. They also should be knowledgeable 
of the risks inherent in changing the sensitivity level of AS storage media or 
of moving media from an installation with a specific security posture tone that 
is less secure. They should use proper procedures to prevent a possible 
disclosure of sensitive information contained on such media. ("Sensitive" in 
this document refers to classified and sensitive but unclassified information.) 
The procedures and guidelines in this document are based on research, 
investigation, current policy, and standard practice.
<P>This guideline is divided as follows: Section 2 provides information on using 
this guideline and introduces DoD terminology. Section 3 discusses the use of 
degaussers and references the Degausser Products List (DPL), a listing of DoD 
evaluated degaussers. Section 4, "Risk Considerations," has information similar 
to that found in version 1 of this document, except for the modification of 
Section 4.2, "Effects of Heat and Age," and the addition of information on 
overwriting and degaussing. Section 5 addresses DoD endorsed erasure standards. 
Recently developed storage technologies and disk exercisers are discussed in 
Section 6. Section 7 addresses areas needing further investigation and provides 
references to additional information on the science of magnetics, as it pertains 
to magnetic remanence.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR1.1   3 9">1.1 PURPOSE</A></H3>The purpose of this publication 
is to provide information to personnel responsible for the secure handling of 
sensitive AIS memory and secondary storage media. (However, this guidance 
applies to any electronic or magnetic storage media, e.g., instrumentation 
tape.) This guideline provides information relating to the clearing, purging, 
declassification, destruction, and release of most AIS storage media. While data 
remanence is not a directly evaluated criterion of trusted computing systems, it 
is an issue critical to the safeguarding of information used by trusted 
computing systems and, as such, is addressed in thA5 National Computer Security 
Center (NCSC) guideline. The NCSC publishes this document because the community 
using trusted computing systems has expressed the desire for this information. 
Additionally, readers should note that this is a guideline only and they should 
not use it in lieu of policy.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR1.2   3 9">1.2 HISTORY</A></H3>As early as 1960 the problem 
caused by the retentive properties of ASI storage media (i.e., data remanence) 
was recognized. It was known that without the application of data removal 
procedures, inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information was possible should 
the storage media be released into an uncontrolled environment. Degaussing, 
overwriting, data encryption, and media destruction are some of the methods that 
have been employed to safeguard against disclosure of sensitive information. 
Over a period of time, certain practices have been accepted for the clearing and 
purging of AIS storage media.
<P>A series of research studies were contracted by the DoD to the Illinois 
Institute of Technology, Research Institute and completed in 1981 and 1982. They 
have confirmed the validity of the degaussing practices as applied to magnetic 
tape media. [19] Additional research conducted at the Carnegie-Mellon University 
using communication theory and magnetic modeling experiments designed to detect 
digital information from erased disks has provided test data on the erasability 
of magnetic disks. [11, 21, and 22] This work, along with DoD research that has 
not yet been released, provides the basis for the disk degaussing standard. More 
studies are planned or underway to ensure the adequacy of DoD degaussing 
standards.
<P>On 2 January 1981, the Director of the National Security Agency assumed 
responsibility for computer security within the Department of Defense. As a 
result, the Department of Defense Computer Security Center (DoDCSC), officially 
chartered by DoD Directive 5215.1, was established at the National Security 
Agency. (3] The DoDCSC Division of Standards (now Division of Standards, 
Criteria, and Guidelines)
<P>was subsequently formed and tasked to support a broad range of computer 
security
<P>related subjects. The DoDCSC became the NCSC in 1985, as amended in National 
Security Decision Directive 145. [15] As part of its mission to provide 
information useful for the secure operation of AISs, the NCSC published the 
<I>Department of Defense Magnetic Remanence Security Guideline</I>, which is 
version 1 of this guideline.
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR2   2 10">2 GENERAL INFORMATION</A></H2>An AIS and its storage 
media should be safeguarded in the manner prescribed for the highest 
classification of information ever processed by the AIS. That is, until the AIS 
and its associated storage media are subjected to an approved purging procedure 
and administratively declassified. There should be continuous assurance that 
sensitive information is protected and not allowed to be placed in a 
circumstance wherein a possible compromise can occur. There are two primary 
levels of threat that the protector of information must guard against: keyboard 
attack (information scavenging through system software capabilities) and 
laboratory attack (information scavenging through laboratory means). Procedures 
should be implemented to address these threats before the AIS is procured, and 
the procedures should be continued throughout the life cycle of the AIS.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR2.1   3 10">2.1 USE OF THIS GUIDELINE</A></H3>Designated 
Approving Authorities and Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) may refer 
to this guideline when selecting or evaluating specific methods to clear, purge, 
declassify, or destroy AIS storage media. DoD components may include the 
information provided in this guideline in their security training and awareness 
program; however, they should not use this guideline in lieu of existing 
policies.
<P>Guidelines in this document have two degrees of emphasis. Those that are most 
important to the secure handling of AIS storage media have such wording as "the 
ISSO should . . . ." Guidance of lesser criticality has such wording as "it is 
good practice" or "it may be." Thus, the word "may" denotes less emphasis or 
concern than the word "should."
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR2.2   3 10">2.2 IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS</A></H3>This section 
provides definitions and their amplification critical to understanding the 
issues in remanence. A comprehensive glossary follows Section 7.
<P><B>Clearing</B>: The removal of sensitive data from an AIS at the end of a 
period of processing, including from AIS storage devices and other peripheral 
devices with storage capacity, in such a way that there is assurance, 
proportional to the sensitivity of the data, that the data may not be 
reconstructed using normal system capabilities, i.e., through the keyboard. 
(This may include use of advanced diagnostic utilities.) An AS need not be 
disconnected from any external network before a clear. [1, draft version]
<P>Clearing can be used when the secured physical environment (where the media 
was used) is maintained. In other words, the media is reused within the same AIS 
and environment previously used.
<P>In an operational computer, clearing can usually be accomplished by an 
overwrite of unassigned system storage space, provided the system can be trusted 
to provide separation of the storage space and unauthorized users. For example, 
a single overwrite of a file or all system storage, if the circumstance warrants 
such an action, is adequate to ensure that previous information cannot be 
reconstructed through a keyboard attack. Note: Simply removing pointers to a 
file, which can occur when a file is simply deleted in some systems, will not 
generally render the previous information unrecoverable through normal system 
capabilities (i.e., diagnostic routines).
<P><B>Purging</B>: The removal of sensitive data from an AIS at the end of a 
period of processing, including from AIS storage devices and other peripheral 
devices with storage capacity, in such a way that there is assurance, 
proportional to the sensitivity of the data, that the data may not be 
reconstructed through open-ended laboratory techniques. An AIS must be 
disconnected from any external network before a purge. [17]
<P>Purging must be used when the secured physical environment (where the media 
was used) will not be maintained. In other words, media scheduled to be released 
from a secure facility to a non-cleared maintenance facility or similar 
non-secure environment must be purged.
<P>Note: The purging definition allows a hierarchy of data eradication 
procedures, although current standards do not take advantage of this. That is, 
removing data with "assurance, proportional to the sensitivity of the data, that 
the data may not be reconstructed" implies that standards can be developed to be 
applied hierarchically. For example, a standard could be developed that allowed 
a security officer to degauss CONFIDENTIAL tapes by 80 db, SECRET tapes by 90 
db, etc. Practice has shown, however, that this is not a feasible approach. 
Authorized clearing and purging procedures are detailed in DoD 5200.28-M and 
sometimes further amplified in DoD component regulations.
<P><B>Declassification</B>: A procedure and an administrative action to remove 
the security classification of the subject media. The procedural aspect of 
declassification is the actual purging of the media and removal of any labels 
denoting classification, possibly replacing them with labels denoting that the 
storage media is unclassified. The administrative aspect is realized through the 
submission to the appropriate authority of a decision memorandum to declassify 
the storage media.
<P>Whether declassifying or downgrading the storage media, the memorandum should 
include the following:
<P>
<DL>
  <DD>a. A description of the media (type, manufacturer, model, and serial 
  number).<BR>
  <DD>b. The media's classification and requested reclassification as a result 
  of this action.<BR>
  <DD>c. A description of the purging procedures to include the make, model 
  number, and serial number of the degausser used and the date of the last 
  degausser test if degaussing is done; or the accreditation statement of the 
  software if overwriting is done; or the description of and authorization to 
  use the purging procedure if the purging procedure is different from the 
  preceding procedures.<BR>
  <DD>d. The names of the people executing the procedures and verifying the 
  results.<BR>
  <DD>e. The reason for the downgrade, declassification, or release.<BR>
  <DD>f. The concurrence of the data owner that the action is necessary.<BR>
  <DD>g. The intended recipient or destination of the AIS and storage 
  media.<BR></DD></DL><B>Coercivity</B>: Measured in oersteds (Oe), is a property 
of magnetic material used as a measure of the amount of applied magnetic field 
(of opposite polarity) required to reduce magnetic induction to zero from its 
remanent state, i.e., taking the media
<P>from a recorded state to an unrecorded state. Coercivity values are available 
from the manufacturer or vendor.
<P><B>Type I Tape</B>: Magnetic tape with coercivity not exceeding 350 Oe (also 
known as low-energy tape), for example, iron oxide coated tape. Note: The 
maximum coercivity level has changed from 325 Oe to 350 Oe.
<P>Magnetic disks, i.e., oxide particles on a metal substrate, also have varying 
coercivity levels. Research has shown, however, that the physical remanence 
properties of disks are easier to address. Because of this, disks are treated as 
Type I media and are discussed in more detail later.
<P><B>Type II Tape</B>: Magnetic tape with coercivity ranging from 351 to 750 Oe 
(also known as high-energy tape), for example, chromium dioxide coated tape.
<P>The determination of the Types l and II definitions was largely a result of 
the tape manufacturing industry. Low-energy tapes were developed first, and they 
have coercivities around 300 Oe + 10%. The next generation tape was high-energy 
tape, whose coercivity is around 650 Oe + 10%. There have been no naturally 
occurring plateaus for which to define a Type Ill tape. As a practical matter, 
there are no degaussers that can yet meet the requirements of National Security 
Agency/Central Security Service (NSA/CSS) Specification L14-4-A for tapes above 
Type II. [13]
<P><B>Type III Tape</B>: Magnetic tape with coercivity above 750 Oe, for 
example, cobalt-modified iron oxide coated tape and metallic particle coated 
tape. This definition is provided so these media may be discussed.
<P><B>Degausser</B>: A device that can generate a magnetic field for degaussing 
magnetic storage media. A Type l degausser can purge Type I tapes and all 
magnetic disks. A Type II degausser can purge both Types I and II tapes. There 
are, at present, no Type III degaussers. Currently, all Type I, II, and III 
tapes may be cleared with a Type I degausser. However, Type III tapes with 
higher than the current maximum coercivity may be developed that would not be 
clearable with a Type I degausser. Refer to the DPL for Type III degausser 
availability. Section 3 discusses degaussers further.
<P><B>Permanent Magnet Degausser</B>: A hand-held permanent magnet that has 
satisfied the requirement to degauss floppy disks, disk platters, magnetic drum 
surfaces, bubble memory chips, and thin film memory modules. It is not used to 
degauss magnetic tape.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR2.3   3 13">2.3 OBJECT REUSE AND DATA REMANENCE</A></H3>The 
issue of data scavenging on multiuser systems was recognized to be an area of 
concern long before the DoD 5200.28-STD, <I>Trusted Computer System Evaluation 
Criteria (TCSEC)</I>, [20] became the metric with which to evaluate trusted 
systems. The TCSEC reflects this concern with its requirement that a Trusted 
Computing Base (TCB) have a mechanism that enforces an object reuse policy. This 
mechanism must ensure that no user can use the TCB interface to recover another 
user's data from recycled storage media (e.g., memory or disk pages). Object 
reuse in trusted computing systems is comparable (in most respects) to 
"clearing."
<P>Object reuse can be implemented so that the address space that contained the 
object (file) is cleared upon deallocation (the net result is that unallocated 
address space is cleared) or upon allocation (the net result is that unallocated 
address space may contain data residue). (Note: There are other ways to 
implement object reuse which do not involve clearing.) Information from a common 
data storage pool cannot normally be retrieved through the keyboard.
<P>Some comparisons have been made between trusted systems that satisfy the 
object reuse requirement and overwrite programs that do only clearing or 
purging; however, it should be noted that overwrite programs cannot be trusted 
in the same sense as trusted systems. This is primarily because of the 
environment in which overwrite programs must operate.
<P>Trusted systems are designed with an object reuse mechanism that is protected 
and supported by the TCB, substantiating the degree of trust placed in the 
object reuse mechanism. Commercially available overwrite programs are usually 
designed to operate on several different systems and are not evaluated with the 
same rigor as trusted systems; however, any overwrite program should be 
protected from unauthorized modification. These two security features provide a 
similar aspect of data confidentiality but satisfy different computer security 
requirements.
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR3   2 13">3 DEGAUSSERS</A></H2>DoD 5200.28-M requires that 
degaussing equipment be tested and approved by a laboratory of a DoD component 
or a commercial testing laboratory where the evaluation tests may be certified. 
Test methods and performance criteria are promulgated in DoD 5200.28-M. National 
Security Agency/Central Security Service (NSA/CSS) Specification L14-4-A, 
<I>Magnetic Tape Degausser</I>, [13] is an updated version of DoD 5200.28-M 
degausser testing requirements. The NSA/CSS has ensured that degausser testing 
criteria are current by publishing NSA/CSS Specification L14-4-A.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR3.1   3 14">3.1 A PRIMER</A></H3>Data are stored in magnetic 
media by making very small areas called magnetic domains change their magnetic 
alignment to be in the direction of an applied magnetic field. This phenomena 
occurs in much the same way that a compass needle points in the direction of the 
earth's magnetic field. Degaussing, commonly called erasure, leaves the domains 
in random patterns with no preference to orientation, thereby rendering previous 
data unrecoverable. There are some domains whose magnetic alignment is not 
randomized after degaussing. The information that these domains represent is 
commonly called magnetic remanence. Proper degaussing will ensure that there is 
insufficient magnetic remanence to reconstruct the data.
<P>Erasure via degaussing may be accomplished in two ways: in AC erasure, the 
media is degaussed by applying an alternating field that is reduced in amplitude 
over time from an initial high value (i.e., AC powered); in DC erasure, the 
media is saturated by applying a unidirectional field (i.e., DC powered or by 
employing a permanent magnet).
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR3.2   3 14">3.2 DEGAUSSER TESTING</A></H3>The DoD has adopted 
the National Security Agency security standard for degaussing equipment, which 
requires degaussers to reduce a special worst-case analog test signal by 90 
decibels (db). More simply stated, degaussing must reduce the test signal to one 
billionth (1 part in 10<EM sup>9</EM>) of its original strength. However, the 
signals recorded on magnetic media are easier to erase than the worst-case test 
signal. This signal is a test signal that magnetically saturates a tape and is 
set forth in references 1 and 13. After the test signal is recorded on the tape, 
the tape is degaussed and the residual signal is evaluated against the 90 db 
standard. This quantifies degausser effectiveness.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR3.3   3 14">3.3 LABELING TAPES</A></H3>It is difficult to 
distinguish the different types of magnetic tape from appearance alone. For this 
reason, it is recommended that responsible personnel ensure that type labels 
(i.e., Type I, II, or III) are applied to the tape reels upon initial use. The 
label should remain on the reel until the tape is cut from the reel or the reel 
is destroyed.
<P>In some cases, adding another label to the tape could introduce the 
possibility of operator error in shops where the reel is already crowded with 
labels. Some facilities require the security officer to use the manufacturer's 
label to determine tape coercivity. In any case, strict inventory controls 
should be in place to ensure that tapes can be identified by type so the correct 
purge procedure is used.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR3.4   3 14">3.4 DEGAUSSER PRODUCTS LIST (DPL)</A></H3>The list 
of magnetic degaussers that satisfy the requirements in NSA/CSS Specification 
L14-4-A is included in the NSA's <I>Information Systems Security Products and 
Services Catalogue</I> [10] as the DPL. The catalogue is updated quarterly and 
is available through the U.S. Government Printing Office.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR3.5   3 15">3.5 DEGAUSSING EQUIPMENT FAILURE</A></H3>Because of 
the possibility of equipment failure, degaussing equipment should be 
periodically tested to verify correct operation throughout the life cycle of the 
equipment. Preventive maintenance should be done on a regular schedule to 
preclude mechanical or electrical problems. Some manufacturers have maintenance 
contracts and recommended maintenance schedules to ensure the integrity of the 
degaussing procedure.
<P>To provide a rough estimate of degausser effectiveness, an on-site test of 
generated magnetic field strength may be done by using a gaussmeter for some 
models of Type I degaussers. (Some Type I degaussers cannot be tested in this
<P>manner because the degaussing field is not accessible.) However, a more 
extensive test is required to maintain an adequate degree of assurance that the 
degausser is operating correctly.
<P>Both Type I and II degaussers may be periodically tested more extensively by 
testing against the 90 db test signal strength reduction requirement in NSA/CSS 
Specification L14-4-A using the following procedure: have the tape prerecorded 
with the specified test signal (in a testing laboratory), degauss the tape, then 
return the tape to the laboratory where it can be tested for the remanent signal 
level. [13] Check with local authorities or engineering personnel to determine 
if such a service is available to your organization. There are two companies 
listed in the DPL, Integra Technologies Corporation and Data Security, 
Incorporated, that can test an installed degausser's effectiveness.
<P>Although this periodic test is not a DoD requirement, it is highly 
recommended. After a degausser is installed, it should be tested periodically 
(approximately every six months) for its first two years of operation. This data 
can be used to develop a histogram of the degausser's operation. Based on this 
information, an informed decision can be made about extending the interval 
between testing, e.g., every 9 months, yearly, every 18 months, etc.
<P>Note that it is erroneous to assume that even a newly installed degausser, 
let alone a degausser several years old, is providing sufficient erasure. It is 
not prudent to rely upon one DoD evaluation of the degausser manufacturer's 
product line because of possible product failure.
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR4   2 15">4 RISK CONSIDERATIONS</A></H2>Many risks should be 
considered when reuse or release of AIS storage media is anticipated. AIS 
security personnel, operations personnel, users, and other designated 
responsible persons should be aware of these risks before attempting to 
declassify or make any decision to release storage media.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.1   3 15">4.1 DESTINATION OF RELEASED MEDIA</A></H3>The risk 
of compromise of sensitive data increases when AIS storage media is released for 
any reason outside of the controlled environment. Personnel should consider the 
media's destination when evaluating this risk.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.2   3 16">4.2 EFFECTS OF HEAT AND AGE</A></H3>Version 1 of 
this document reported that magnetic media stored for either an extended period 
of time or under high temperature conditions (120 degrees Fahrenheit or greater) 
becomes more difficult to degauss or erase. Additional research is in progress 
to validate the effects of heat and age on the erasure process. [14]
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.3   3 16">4.3 MECHANICAL STORAGE DEVICE EQUIPMENT 
FAILURE</A></H3>Some of the early disk drives required manual alignment of 
read/write heads. The effectiveness of an overwrite on this technology base may 
be reduced because of equipment failure or mechanical faults, such as 
misalignment of read/write heads. Hardware preventive maintenance procedures 
should be done on schedule, and records should be maintained in an effort to 
prevent this problem.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.4   3 16">4.4 STORAGE DEVICE SEGMENTS NOT RECEPTIVE TO 
OVERWRITE</A></H3>A compromise of sensitive data may occur if media is released 
when an addressable segment of a storage device (such as unusable or "bad" 
tracks in a disk drive or inter-record gaps in tapes) is not receptive to an 
overwrite. As an example, a disk platter may develop unusable tracks or sectors; 
however, sensitive data may have been previously recorded in these areas. It may 
be difficult to overwrite these unusable tracks. Before sensitive information is 
written to a disk, all unusable tracks, sectors, or blocks should be identified 
(mapped). During the life cycle of a disk, additional unusable areas may be 
identified. If this occurs and these tracks cannot be overwritten, then 
sensitive information may remain on these tracks. In this case, overwriting is 
not an acceptable purging method and the media should be degaussed or destroyed.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.5   3 16">4.5 OVERWRITE SOFTWARE AND 
CLEARING</A></H3>Overwriting is an effective method of clearing data. In an 
operational system, an overwrite of unassigned system storage space can usually 
accomplish this, provided the system can be trusted to provide separation of 
system resources and unauthorized users. For example, a single overwrite of a 
file (or all system storage, if the circumstance warrants such an action) is 
adequate to ensure that previous information cannot be reconstructed through a 
keyboard attack. Note: Simply removing pointers to the file will not generally 
render the previous information unrecoverable. Software used for clearing should 
be under strict configuration controls. See <I>A Guide to Understanding 
Configuration Management in Trusted Systems</I> for additional information on 
this subject. [7]
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.6   3 16">4.6 OVERWRITE SOFTWARE AND PURGING</A></H3>The DoD 
has approved overwriting and degaussing for purging data, although the 
effectiveness of overwriting cannot be guaranteed without examining each 
application. If overwriting is to be used in a specific application, software 
developers must design the software such that the software continues to write to 
all addressable locations on the media, in spite of intermediate errors. All 
such errors in usable sectors should be reported with a listing of current 
content. In addition, unusable sectors must be completely overwritten, because 
the unusable sector list will not show whether the sector ever contained any 
sensitive data. If any errors occur while overwriting or if any unusable sector 
could not be overwritten, then degaussing is required.
<P>There are additional risks to trusting overwrite software to purge disks. The 
environment in which the software must operate is difficult to constrain. For 
this reason, care must be exercised during software development to ensure the 
software cannot be subverted. The overwrite software should be protected at the 
level of the media it purges, and strict configuration controls should be in 
place on both the operating system the software must run under and the software 
itself. The overwrite software must be protected from unauthorized modification. 
[7]
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.7   3 17">4.7 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION</A></H3>Leased equipment 
containing non-removable magnetic storage media should not be returned to the 
vendor unless the media is declassified using an approved procedure. Problems 
may be encountered obtaining warranty repair service or returning the equipment 
at termination of lease. Contractual maintenance agreements should address the 
issue of degaussed media and its effect on equipment warranties.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.8   3 17">4.8 MAINTENANCE</A></H3>Proper purging is especially 
important in relation to maintenance, whether routine or not. Purge procedures 
should be conducted and the device declassified before uncleared personnel 
undertake maintenance actions. If purging is impractical, prohibitively 
expensive, or could destroy the device, then precautions should be taken to 
reduce the threat to sensitive information on the device. Maintenance actions 
should be observed by an individual who has been provided with guidance so that 
improper actions can be discerned and unauthorized disclosure can be prevented.
<P>If test and diagnostic equipment (T &amp; DE) is used on an AIS that has not 
been purged, there is a possibility that the T &amp; DE can capture sensitive 
information. To prevent unauthorized disclosure, the T &amp; DE should either be 
purged after use or remain safeguarded at the highest level of information 
resident on the AIS.
<P>For example, if a sensitive disk drive is serviced, the escort official 
should know that the maintenance person is not allowed to remove the damaged 
disk from the facility. The escort also should be capable of identifying when a 
maintenance person has altered the protective characteristics of the device.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.9   3 17">4.9 DATA SENSITIVITY</A></H3>AIS storage media may 
have contained information so sensitive that authorities decided to never allow 
declassification of the AIS or its storage media. Examples of such sensitive 
information are communications security (COMSEC) information marked CRYPTO or 
Single Integrated Operational Plan (SlOP) information. In these cases, the 
holder of the media should not attempt to declassify or release the media except 
as directed by proper organizational approving authorities. [9] Destruction may 
be the only alternative to indefinite storage of such highly sensitive media.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.10   3 18">4.10 DEGAUSSING</A></H3>Although degaussing is the 
best method for purging most magnetic storage media, it is not without risk. 
Degaussers can be used improperly. For example, the media may be removed before 
the degaussing cycle is complete. Also, degaussers can fail or have a reduced 
capability over time. Good degausser design can alleviate much, but not all, of 
this risk. This risk can be mitigated by periodic testing (see Section 3.5, 
"Degaussing Equipment Failure").
<P>Mistakenly using a Type I degausser to purge Type II tape is another risk. 
Type I degaussers cannot purge Type II tape. Magnetic tape should have a label 
applied to the reel that identifies the coercivity of the media, because 
coercivity cannot always be distinguished by physical appearance. Strict 
inventory controls should be in place to ensure tapes can be identified by type 
so the correct purge procedure is used. If type labels are used, they should not 
be removed from the reel unless the tape is cut from the reel or the reel itself 
is destroyed. Labels that show classification should not be removed from the 
reel until the media is declassified. See Section 3.3, "Labeling Tapes," for 
more information about labels.
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR5   2 18">5 STANDARDS</A></H2>
<H3><A name="HDR5.1   3 18">5.1 GENERIC PROCEDURES</A></H3>There are two primary 
procedures allowed by DoD policy for clearing and purging AIS memory and 
secondary storage media that have processed sensitive information: overwriting 
and degaussing. [1] Other procedures are media specific and this section details 
them where appropriate. The need for destruction arises when the media reaches 
the end of its useful life.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR5.1.1   4 18">5.1.1 OVERWRITING</A></H4>Overwriting is a process 
whereby unclassified data are written to storage locations that previously held 
sensitive data. To satisfy the DoD clearing requirement, it is sufficient to 
write any character to all data locations in question. To purge the AIS storage 
media, the DoD requires overwriting with a pattern, then its complement, and 
finally with another pattern; e.g., overwrite first with 0011 0101, followed by 
1100 1010, then 1001 0111. The number of times an overwrite must be accomplished 
depends on the storage media, sometimes on its sensitivity, and sometimes on 
differing DoD component requirements. In any case, a purge is not complete until 
a final overwrite is made using unclassified data.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR5.1.2   4 18">5.1.2 DEGAUSSING</A></H4>Degaussing is a process 
whereby the magnetic media is erased, i.e., returned to its initial virgin 
state. To satisfy the DoD requirement on degaussing a classified magnetic tape, 
the degausser must have met DoD testing requirements as discussed in Section 3, 
"Degaussers."
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR5.1.3   4 19">5.1.3 DESTRUCTION</A></H4>It is good practice to 
purge media before submitting it for destruction. Media may generally be 
destroyed by one of the following methods. (Although approved methods, options d 
and e use acid, which is dangerous and excessive, to remove recording surfaces. 
Options a, b, and c are recommended over d and e.)

storage media. This section, "Standards," is a reflection of those procedures 
but does not provide the entire procedure (e.g., use three overwrites to purge

<H4><A name="HDR5.2.1   4 19">5.2.1 MAGNETIC TAPES</A></H4>Although overwriting 
can be used for clearing this media, the method is time consuming and generally

method for <B>clearing</B> Type I, II, and III tapes is degaussing with a

media. See Section 4, "Risk Considerations," and DoD 5200.28-M for additional 
information. Degaussed disks will generally require restoration of factory 
installed timing tracks. Type I degaussers and approved hand-held magnets can 
purge this media up to a coercivity level of 1100 oersteds. If hand-held magnets 
are used, then the magnet must be placed in almost direct contact with the disk, 
separated by only a tissue to prevent scratching the disk. Sometimes it is 
possible to insert the magnet between the platters without disassembling them. 
As a practical matter, if the drive must be disassembled, it is usually easier 
to destroy the platters than to degauss and then reinstall them.
<P>Recently completed research has indicated that degaussing is an effective 
method to purge rigid disk media. Large cavity degaussing equipment can be used 
to erase the data from sealed disk packs and Winchester style hard disk drives 
while the platters remain in the drive. Care must be exercised to ensure that 
the disk drive is not encased in a material that conducts a magnetic field. 
Research has shown that aluminum housings on Winchester disk drives attenuate 
the degaussing field by only about 2 db. Operational guidance is now being 
developed for the DoD.

to disk exercisers, which use a dedicated operating system. Winchester disk 
manufacturers use disk exercisers to do as their name implies-put Winchester 
disk drives through their paces. To purge a Winchester drive, the Winchester 
unit must be plugged into the disk exerciser. The disk exerciser is able to 
write to any part of a disk regardless of whether the operating system labeled 
the sector unusable. Some of these "exercisers" also have the capability of 
writing at different frequencies. This makes them a more effective alternative 
to overwrite software; however, their ability to purge disks has not been 
tested.
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR7   2 22">7 FUTURE DIRECTIONS</A></H2>Several areas in data 
remanence can benefit from more investigation. After the adequacy of overwrites 
to ensure purging is determined, the use of disk exercisers for the purging of 
magnetic disks should be researched. Because of the increasing use of 
magneto-optical disks, research should be initiated on methods to purge this 
media also.
<P>A good primer on magnetic coatings used for disks and tapes is <I>Particulate 
Magnetic Recording: A Review</I>, by Michael P. Sharrock. [18] For a discourse 
on future storage trends, see <I>Data Storage in 2000-Trends in Data Storage 
Technologies</I>, by Mark H. Kryder. [12] The <I>IEEE Transactions on 
Magnetics</I> provides a wealth of information on the field of magnetics, with 
entire sections devoted to engineering-level discussions related to magnetic 
remanence in AIS storage media.
<P>Announcements concerning cavity degaussers should be forthcoming. See the 
Degausser Products List for these announcements and for announcements about 
decisions concerning magnetic media degaussing.
<P>DoD policy, procedures, and guidance need continual refinement to keep pace 
with the evolving storage technologies. Although there is no focal point 
responsible for ensuring erasure standards are current, various agencies have 
sponsored research that has ensured our erasure standards provide an adequate 
degree of security. This has caused duplication of effort at times, but it has 
also provided additional validation of earlier work. However, a focal point 
would ensure research is duplicated only when necessary. As storage technology 
advances and clear and purge procedures are developed and refined, this 
guideline will be periodically updated to reflect the changes. DoD 5200.28-M 
should be updated also.
