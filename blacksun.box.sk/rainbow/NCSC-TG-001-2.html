guideline there will be recommendations made that are not included in the 
Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (the Criteria) as requirements. Any 
recommendations that are not in the Criteria will be prefaced by the word

<H2><A name="HDR1.1   3 10">1.1 History of the National Computer Security Center 
</A></H2>
<P>The DoD Computer Security Center (DoDCSC) was established in January 1981 for 
the purpose of expanding on the work started by the DoD Security Initiative. 
Accordingly, the Director, National Computer Security Center, has the 
responsibility for establishing and publishing standards and guidelines for all 
areas of computer security. In 1985, DoDCSC's name was changed to the National 
Computer Security Center to reflect its responsibility for computer security 
throughout the federal government. 
<H2><A name="HDR1.2   3 10">1.2 Goal of the National Computer Security Center 
</A></H2>The main goal of the National Computer Security Center is to encourage 
the widespread availability of trusted computer systems. In support of that goal 
a metric was created, the DoD Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (the 
Criteria), against which computer systems could be evaluated for security. The 
Criteria was originally published on 15 August 1983 as CSC-STD-001-83. In 
December 1985 the DoD adopted it, with a few changes, as a DoD Standard, DoD 
5200.28-STD. DoD Directive 5200.28, "Security Requirements for Automatic Data 
Processing (ADP) Systems" has been written to, among other things, require the 
Department of Defense Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria to be used 
throughout the DoD. The Criteria is the standard used for evaluating the 
effectiveness of security controls built into ADP systems. The Criteria is 
divided into four divisions: D, C, B, and A, ordered in a hierarchical manner 
with the highest division (A) being reserved for systems providing the best 
available level of assurance. Within divisions C and B there are a number of 
subdivisions known as classes, which are also ordered in a hierarchical manner 
to represent different levels of security in these classes. 
<HR>

<H1><A name="HDR2   2 10">2. PURPOSE </A></H1>
<P>For Criteria classes C2 through A1 the Criteria requires that a user's 
actions be open to scrutiny by means of an audit. The audit process of a secure 
system is the process of recording, examining, and reviewing any or all 
security-relevant activities on the system. This guideline is intended to 
discuss issues involved in implementing and evaluating an audit mechanism. The 
purpose of this document is twofold. It provides guidance to manufacturers on 
how to design and incorporate an effective audit mechanism into their system, 
and it provides guidance to implementors on how to make effective use of the 
audit capabilities provided by trusted systems. This document contains 
suggestions as to what information should be recorded on the audit trail, how 
the audit should be conducted, and what protective measures should be accorded 
to the audit resources. Any examples in this document are not to be construed as 
the only implementations that will satisfy the Criteria requirement. The 
examples are merely suggestions of appropriate implementations. The 
recommendations in this document are also not to be construed as supplementary 
requirements to the Criteria. The Criteria is the only metric against which 
systems are to be evaluated. 
<P>This guideline is part of an on-going program to provide helpful guidance on 
Criteria issues and the features they address. 
<HR>

<H1><A name="HDR3   2 11">3. SCOPE </A></H1>An important security feature of 
Criteria classes C2 through A1 is the ability of the ADP system to audit any or 
all of the activities on the system. This guideline will discuss auditing and 
the features of audit facilities as they apply to computer systems and products 
that are being built with the intention of meeting the requirements of the 
Criteria. 
<P>
<HR>

<H1><A name="HDR4   2 11">4. CONTROL OBJECTIVES</A></H1>The Trusted Computer 
System Evaluation Criteria gives the following as the Accountability Control 
Objective: 
<DL>
  <DD>"Systems that are used to process or handle classified or other sensitive 
  information must assure individual accountability whenever either a mandatory 
  or discretionary security policy is invoked. Furthermore, to assure 
  accountability the capability must exist for an authorized and competent agent 
  to access and evaluate accountability information by a secure means, within a 
  reasonable amount of time and without undue difficulty."(1) </DD></DL>The 
Accountability Control Objective as it relates to auditing leads to the 
following control objective for auditing: 
<DL>
  <DD>"A trusted computer system must provide authorized personnel with the 
  ability to audit any action that can potentially cause access to, generation 
  of, or effect the release of classified or sensitive information. The audit 
  data will be selectively acquired based on the auditing needs of a particular 
  installation and/or application. However, there must be sufficient granularity 
  in the audit data to support tracing the auditable events to a specific 
  individual (or process) who has taken the actions or on whose behalf the 
  actions were taken."(1) </DD></DL>
<HR>

<H1><A name="HDR5   2 12">5. OVERVIEW OF AUDITING PRINCIPLES </A></H1>Audit 
trails are used to detect and deter penetration of a computer system and to 
reveal usage that identifies misuse. At the discretion of the auditor, audit 
trails may be limited to specific events or may encompass all of the activities 
on a system. Although not required by the TCSEC, it should be possible for the 
target of the audit mechanism to be either a subject or an object. That is to 
say, the audit mechanism should be capable of monitoring every time John 
accessed the system as well as every time the nuclear reactor file was accessed; 
and likewise every time John accessed the nuclear reactor file. 
<P>
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR5.1   3 12">5.1 Purpose of the Audit Mechanism </A></H2>
<P>The audit mechanism of a computer system has five important security goals. 
First, the audit mechanism must "allow the review of patterns of access to 
individual objects, access histories of specific processes and individuals, and 
the use of the various protection mechanisms supported by the system and their 
effectiveness."(2) Second, the audit mechanism must allow discovery of both 
users' and outsiders' repeated attempts to bypass the protection mechanisms. 
Third, the audit mechanism must allow discovery of any use of privileges that 
may occur when a user assumes a functionality with privileges greater than his 
or her own, i.e., programmer to administrator. In this case there may be no 
bypass of security controls but nevertheless a violation is made possible. 
Fourth, the audit mechanism must act as a deterrent against perpetrators' 
habitual attempts to bypass the system protection mechanisms. However, to act as 
a deterrent, the perpetrator must be aware of the audit mechanism's existence 
and its active use to detect any attempts to bypass system protection 
mechanisms. The fifth goal of the audit mechanism is to supply "an additional 
form of user assurance that attempts to bypass the protection mechanisms are 
recorded and discovered."(2) Even if the attempt to bypass the protection 
mechanism is successful, the audit trail will still provide assurance by its 
ability to aid in assessing the damage done by the violation, thus improving the 
system's ability to control the damage. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR5.2   3 13">5.2 Users of the Audit Mechanism </A></H2>
<P>"The users of the audit mechanism can be divided into two groups. The first 
group consists of the auditor, who is an individual with administrative duties, 
who selects the events to be audited on the system, sets up the audit flags 
which enable the recording of those events, and analyzes the trail of audit 
events."(2) In some systems the duties of the auditor may be encompassed in the 
duties of the system security administrator. Also, at the lower classes, the 
auditor role may be performed by the system administrator. This document will 
refer to the person responsible for auditing as the system security 
administrator, although it is understood that the auditing guidelines may apply 
to system administrators and/or system security administrators and/or a separate 
auditor in some ADP systems. 
<P>"The second group of users of the audit mechanism consists of the system 
users themselves; this group includes the administrators, the operators, the 
system programmers, and all other users. They are considered users of the audit 
mechanism not only because they, and their programs, generate audit events,"(2) 
but because they must understand that the audit mechanism exists and what impact 
it has on them. This is important because otherwise the user deterrence and user 
assurance goals of the audit mechanism cannot be achieved. 
<P>
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR5.3   3 13">5.3 Aspects of Effective Auditing </A></H2>
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR5.3.1   4 13">5.3.1 Identification/Authentication </A></H3>
<P>Logging in on a system normally requires that a user enter the specified form 
of identification (e.g., login ID, magnetic strip) and a password (or some other 
mechanism) for authentication. Whether this information is valid or invalid, the 
execution of the login procedure is an auditable event and the identification 
entered may be considered to be auditable information. It is recommended that 
authentication information, such as passwords, not be forwarded to the audit 
trail. In the event that the identification entered is not recognized as being 
valid, the system should also omit this information from the audit trail. The 
reason for this is that a user may have entered a password when the system 
expected a login ID. If the information had been written to the audit trail, it 
would compromise the password and the security of the user. 
<P>
<P>There are, however, environments where the risk involved in recording invalid 
identification information is reduced. In systems that support formatted 
terminals, the likelihood of password entry in the identification field is 
markedly reduced, hence the recording of identification information would pose 
no major threat. The benefit of recording the identification information is that 
break-in attempts would be easier to detect and identifying the perpetrator 
would also be assisted. The information gathered here may be necessary for any 
legal prosecution that may follow a security violation.

<H3><A name="HDR5.3.2   4 14">5.3.2 Administrative </A></H3>
<P>All systems rated at class C2 or higher shall have audit capabilities and 
personnel designated as responsible for the audit procedures. For the C2 and B1 
classes, the duties of the system operators could encompass all functions 
including those of the auditor. Starting at the B2 class, there is a requirement 
for the TCB to support separate operator and administrator functions. In 
addition, at the B3 class and above, there is a requirement to identify the 
system security administrator functions. When one assumes the system security 
administrator role on the system, it shall be after taking distinct auditable 
action, e.g., login procedure. When one with the privilege of assuming the role 
is on the system, the act of assuming that role shall also be an auditable 
event.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR5.3.3   4 14">5.3.3 System Design </A></H3>
<P>The system design should include a mechanism to invoke the audit function at 
the request of the system security administrator. A mechanism should also be 
included to determine if the event is to be selected for inclusion as an audit 
trail entry. If pre-selection of events is not implemented, then all auditable 
events should be forwarded to the audit trail. The Criteria requirement for the 
administrator to be able to select events based on user identity and/or object 
security classification must still be able to be satisfied. This requirement can 
be met by allowing post-selection of events through the use of queries. Whatever 
reduction tool is used to analyze the audit trail shall be provided by the 
vendor.

<P>Being able to immediately notify the system security administrator when

<H1><A name="HDR7   2 20">7. POSSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION METHODS </A></H1>The 
techniques for implementing the audit requirements will vary from system to 
system depending upon the characteristics of the software, firmware, and 
hardware involved and any optional features that are to be available. 
Technologically advanced techniques that are available should be used to the 
best advantage in the system design to provide the requisite security as well as 
cost-effectiveness and performance. 
<H2><A name="HDR7.1   3 20">7.1 Pre/Post Selection of Auditable Events 
</A></H2>There is a requirement at classes C2 and above that all security- 
relevant events be auditable. However, these events may or may not always be 
recorded on the audit trail. Options that may be exercised in selecting which 
events should be audited include a pre-selection feature and a post-selection 
feature. A system may choose to implement both options, a pre-selection option 
only, or a post-selection option only. 
<P>If a system developer chooses not to implement a general pre/post selection 
option, there is still a requirement to allow the administrator to selectively 
audit the actions of specified users for all Criteria classes. Starting at the 
B1 class, the administrator shall also be able to audit based on object security 
level. 
<P>There should be options to allow selection by either individuals or groups of 
users. For example, the administrator may select events related to a specified 
individual or select events related to individuals included in a specified 
group. Also, the administrator may specify that events related to the audit file 
be selected or, at classes B1 and above, that accesses to objects with a given 
sensitivity level, such as Top Secret, be selected. 
<H3><A name="HDR7.1.1   4 21">7.1.1 Pre-Selection </A></H3>For each auditable 
event the TCB should contain a mechanism to indicate if the event is to be 
recorded on the audit trail. The system security administrator or designee shall 
be the only person authorized to select the events to be recorded. Pre-selection 
may be by user(s) identity, and at the B1 class and above, pre-selection may 
also be possible by object security level. Although the system security 
administrator shall be authorized to select which events are to be recorded, the 
system security administrator should not be able to exclude himself from being 
audited. 
<P>Although it would not be recommended, the system security administrator may 
have the capability to select that no events be recorded regardless of the 
Criteria requirements. The intention here is to provide flexibility. The purpose 
of designing audit features into a system is not to impose the Criteria on users 
that may not want it, but merely to provide the capability to implement the 
requirements. 
<P>A disadvantage of pre-selection is that it is very hard to predict what 
events may be of security-relevant interest at a future date. There is always 
the possibility that events not pre-selected could one day become 
security-relevant, and the potential loss from not auditing these events would 
be impossible to determine. 
<P>The advantage of pre-selection could possibly be better performance as a 
result of not auditing all the events on the system. 
<H3><A name="HDR7.1.2   4 21">7.1.2 Post-Selection </A></H3>If the 
post-selection option to select only specified events from an existing audit 
trail is implemented, again, only authorized personnel shall be able to make 
this selection. Inclusion of this option requires that the system should have 
trusted facilities (as described in section 9.1) to accept query/retrieval 
requests, to expand any compressed data, and to output the requested data. 
<P>The main advantage of post-selection is that information that may prove 
useful in the future is already recorded on an audit trail and may be queried at 
any time. 
<P>The disadvantage involved in post-selection could possibly be degraded 
performance due to the writing and storing of what could possibly be a very 
large audit trail. 
<H2><A name="HDR7.2   3 22">7.2 Data Compression </A></H2>"Since a system that 
selects all events to be audited may generate a large amount of data, it may be 
necessary to encode the data to conserve space and minimize the processor time 
required" to record the audit records.(3) If the audit trail is encoded, a 
complementary mechanism must be included to decode the data when required. The 
decoding of the audit trail may be done as a preprocess before the audit records 
are accessed by the database or as a postprocess after a relevant record has 
been found. Such decoding is necessary to present the data in an understandable 
form both at the administrators terminal and on batch reports. The cost of 
compressing the audit trail would be the time required for the compression and 
expansion processes. The benefit of compressing data is the savings in storage 
and the savings in time to write the records to the audit trail. 
<H2><A name="HDR7.3   3 22">7.3 Multiple Audit Trails </A></H2>All events 
included on the audit trail may be written as part of the same audit trail, but 
some systems may prefer to have several distinct audit trails, e.g., one would 
be for "user" events, one for "operator" events, and one for "system security 
administrator" events. This would result in several smaller trails for 
subsequent analysis. In some cases, however, it may be necessary to combine the 
information from the trails when questionable events occur in order to obtain a 
composite of the sequence of events as they occurred. In cases where there are 
multiple audit trails, it is preferred that there be some accurate, or at least 
synchronized, time stamps across the multiple logs. 
<P>Although the preference for several distinct audit trails may be present, it 
is important to note that it is often more useful that the TCB be able to 
present all audit data as one comprehensive audit trail. 
<H2><A name="HDR7.4   3 23">7.4 Physical Storage </A></H2>A factor to consider 
in the selection of the medium to be used for the audit trail would be the 
expected usage of the system. The I/O volume for a system with few users 
executing few applications would be quite different from that of a large system 
with a multitude of users performing a variety of applications. In any case, 
however, the system should notify the system operator or administrator when the 
audit trail medium is approaching its storage capacity. Adequate advance 
notification to the operator is especially necessary if human intervention is 
required. 
<P>If the audit trail storage medium is saturated before it is replaced, the 
operating system shall detect this and take some appropriate action such as: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD>1. Notifying the operator that the medium is "full" and action is 
  necessary. The system should then stop and require rebooting. Although a valid 
  option, this action creates a severe threat of denial-of-service attacks. 
  <DD>2. Storing the current audit records on a temporary medium with the 
  intention of later migration to the normal operational medium, thus allowing 
  auditing to continue. This temporary storage medium should be afforded the 
  same protection as the regular audit storage medium in order to prevent any 
  attempts to tamper with it. 
  <DD>3. Delaying input of new actions and/or slowing down current operations to 
  prevent any action that requires use of the audit mechanism. 
  <DD>4. Stopping until the administrative personnel make more space available 
  for writing audit records. 
  <DD>5. Stopping auditing entirely as a result of a decision by the system 
  security administrator. </DD></DL>Any action that is taken in response to 
storage overflow shall be audited. There is, however, a case in which the action 
taken may not be audited that deserves mention. It is possible to have the 
system security administrator's decisions embedded in the system logic. Such 
pre-programmed choices, embedded in the system logic, may be triggered 
automatically and this action may not be audited. 
<P>Still another consideration is the speed at which the medium operates. It 
should be able to accommodate the "worst case" condition such as when there are 
a large number of users on the system and all auditable events are to be 
recorded. This worst case rate should be estimated during the system design 
phase and (when possible) suitable hardware should be selected for this purpose. 

<P>Regardless of how the system handles audit trail overflow, there must be a 
way to archive all of the audit data. 
<H2><A name="HDR7.5   3 24">7.5 Write-Once Device </A></H2>For the lower 
Criteria classes (e.g., C2, B1) the audit trail may be the major tool used in 
detecting security compromises. Implicit in this is that the audit resources 
should provide the maximum protection possible. One technique that may be 
employed to protect the audit trail is to record it on a mechanism designed to 
be a write-only device. Other choices would be to set the designated device to 
write-once mode by disabling the read mechanism. This method could prevent an 
attacker from erasing or modifying the data already written on the audit trail 
because the attacker will not be able to go back and read or find the data that 
he or she wishes to modify. 
<P>If a hardware device is available that permits only the writing of data on a 
medium, modification of data already recorded would be quite difficult. Spurious 
messages could be written, but to locate and modify an already recorded message 
would be difficult. Use of a write-once device does not prevent a penetrator 
from modifying audit resources in memory, including any buffers, in the current 
audit trail. 
<P>If a write-once device is used to record the audit trail, the medium can 
later be switched to a compatible read device to allow authorized personnel to 
analyze the information on the audit trail in order to detect any attempts to 
penetrate the system. If a penetrator modified the audit software to prevent 
writing records on the audit trail, the absence of data during an extended 
period of time would indicate a possible security compromise. The disadvantage 
of using a write-once device is that it necessitates a delay before the audit 
trail is available for analysis by the administrator. This may be offset by 
allowing the system security administrator to review the audit trail in 
real-time by getting copies of all audit records on their way to the device. 
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR7.6   3 25">7.6 Forwarding Audit Data </A></H2>If the facilities 
are available, another method of protecting the audit trail would be to forward 
it to a dedicated processor. The audit trail should then be more readily 
available for analysis by the system security administrator. 
<HR>

<H1><A name="HDR8   2 25">8. OTHER TOPICS </A></H1>
<H2><A name="HDR8.1   3 25">8.1 Audit Data Reduction </A></H2>Depending upon the 
amount of activity on a system and the audit selection process used, the audit 
trail size may vary. It is a safe assumption though, that the audit trail would 
grow to sizes that would necessitate some form of audit data reduction. The data 
reduction tool would most likely be a batch program that would interface to the 
system security administrator. This batch run could be a combination of database 
query language and a report generator with the input being a standardized audit 
file. 
<P>Although they are not necessarily part of the TCB, the audit reduction tools 
should be maintained under the same configuration control system as the 
remainder of the system. 
<H2><A name="HDR8.2   3 25">8.2 Availability of Audit Data </A></H2>In standard 
data processing, audit information is recorded as it occurs. Although most 
information is not required to be immediately available for real-time analysis, 
the system security administrator should have the capability to retreive audit 
information within minutes of its recording. The delay between recording audit 
information and making it available for analysis should be minimal, in the range 
of several minutes. 
<P>For events which do require immediate attention, at the B3 class and above, 
an alert shall be sent out to the system security administrator. In systems that 
store the audit trail in a buffer, the system security administrator should have 
the capability to cause the buffer to be written out. Regarding real-time 
alarms, where they are sent is system dependent. 
<H2><A name="HDR8.3   3 26">8.3 Audit Data Retention </A></H2>The exact period 
of time required for retaining the audit trail is site dependent and should be 
documented in the site's operating procedures manual. When trying to arrive at 
the optimum time for audit trail retention, any time restrictions on the storage 
medium should be considered. The storage medium used must be able to reliably 
retain the audit data for the amount of time required by the site. 
<P>The audit trail should be reviewed at least once a week. It is very possible 
that once a week may be too long to wait to review the audit trail. Depending on 
the amount of audit data expected by the system, this parameter should be 
adjusted accordingly. The recommended time in between audit trail reviews should 
be documented in the Trusted Facility Manual. 
<H2><A name="HDR8.4   3 26">8.4 Testing </A></H2>The audit resources, along with 
all other resources protected by the TCB, have increasing assurance requirements 
at each higher Criteria class. For the lower classes, an audit trail would be a 
major factor in detecting penetration attempts. Unfortunately, at these lower 
classes, the audit resources are more susceptible to penetration and corruption. 
"The TCB must provide some assurance that the data will still be there when the 
administrator tries to use it."(3) The testing requirement recognizes the 
vulnerability of the audit trail, and starting with the C2 class, shall include 
a search for obvious flaws that would corrupt or destroy the audit trail. If the 
audit trail is corrupted or destroyed, the existence of such flaws indicates 
that the system can be penetrated. Testing should also be performed to uncover 
any ways of circumventing the audit mechanisms. The "flaws found in testing may 
be neutralized in any of a number of ways. One way available to the system 
designer is to audit all uses of the mechanism in which the flaw is found and to 
log such events."(3) An attempt should be made to remove the flaw. 
<P>At class B2 and above, it is required that all detected flaws shall be 
corrected or else a lower rating will be given. If during testing the audit 
trail appears valid, analysis of this data can verify that it does or does not 
accurately reflect the events that should be included on the audit trail. Even 
though system assurances may increase at the higher classes, the audit trail is 
still an effective tool during the testing phase as well as operationally in 
detecting actual or potential security compromises. 
<H2><A name="HDR8.5   3 27">8.5 Documentation </A></H2>Starting at the C2 class, 
documentation concerning the audit requirements shall be contained in the 
Trusted Facility Manual. The Trusted Facility Manual shall explain the 
procedures to record, examine, and maintain audit files. It shall detail the 
audit record structure for each type of audit event, and should include what 
each field is and what the size of the field is. 
<P>The Trusted Facility Manual shall also include a complete description of the 
audit mechanism interface, how it should be used, its default settings, cautions 
about the trade-offs involved in using various configurations and capabilities, 
and how to set up and run the system such that the audit data is afforded 
appropriate protection. 
<P>If audit events can be pre- or post-selected, the manual should also describe 
the tools and mechanisms available and how they are to be used. 
<H2><A name="HDR8.6   3 27">8.6 Unavoidable Security Risks </A></H2>There are 
certain risks contained in the audit process that exist simply because there is 
no way to prevent these events from ever occurring. Because there are certain 
unpredictable factors involved in auditing, i.e., man, nature, etc., the audit 
mechanism may never be one hundred per cent reliable. Preventive measures may be 
taken to minimize the likelihood of any of these factors adversely affecting the 
security provided by the audit mechanism, but no audit mechanism will ever be 
risk free. 
<H3><A name="HDR8.6.1   4 27">8.6.1 Auditing Administrators/Insider Threat 
</A></H3>Even with auditing mechanisms in place to detect and deter security 
violations, the threat of the perpetrator actually being the system security 
administrator or someone involved with the system security design will always be 
present. It is quite possible that the system security administrator of a secure 
system could stop the auditing of activities while entering the system and 
corrupting files for personal benefit. These authorized personnel, who may also 
have access to identification and authentication information, could also choose 
to enter the system disguised as another user in order to commit crimes under a 
false identity. 
<P>Management should be aware of this risk and should be certain to exercise 
discretion when selecting the system security administrator. The person who is 
to be selected for a trusted position, such as the system security 
administrator, should be subject to a background check before being granted the 
privileges that could one day be used against the employer. 
<P>The system security administrator could also be watched to ensure that there 
are no unexplained variances in normal duties. Any deviation from the norm of 
operations may indicate that a violation of security has occurred or is about to 
occur. 
<P>An additional security measure to control this insider threat is to ensure 
that the system administrator and the person responsible for the audit are two 
different people. "The separation of the auditor's functions, databases, and 
access privileges from those of the system administrator is an important 
application of the separation of privilege and least privilege principles. 
Should such a separation not be performed, and should the administrator be 
allowed to undertake auditor functions or vice-versa, the entire security 
function would become the responsibility of a single, unaccountable 
individual."(2) 
<P>Another alternative may be to employ separate auditor roles. Such a situation 
may give one person the authority to turn off the audit mechanism, while another 
person may have the authority to turn it back on. In this case no individual 
would be able to turn off the audit mechanism, compromise the system, and then 
turn it back on. 
<H3><A name="HDR8.6.2   4 28">8.6.2 Data Loss </A></H3>Although the audit 
software and hardware are reliable security mechanisms, they are not infallible. 
They, like the rest of the system, are dependent upon constant supplies of power 
and are readily subject to interruption due to mechanical or power failures. 
Their failure can cause the loss or destruction of valuable audit data. The 
system security administrator should be aware of this risk and should establish 
some procedure that would ensure that the audit trail is preserved somewhere. 
The system security administrator should duplicate the audit trail on a 
removable medium at certain points in time to minimize the data loss in the 
event of a system failure. The Trusted Facility Manual should include what the 
possibilities and nature of loss exposure are, and how the data may be recovered 
in the event that a catastrophe does occur. 
<P>If a mechanical or power failure occurs, the system security administrator 
should ensure that audit mechanisms still function properly after system 
recovery. For example, any auditing mechanism options pre-selected before the 
system malfunction must still be the ones in operation after the system 
recovery.

<H1><A name="HDR9   2 29">9. AUDIT SUMMARY </A></H1>
<P>For classes C2 and above, it is required that the TCB "be able to create, 
maintain, and protect from modification or unauthorized access or destruction an 
audit trail of accesses to the objects it protects."(1) The audit trail plays a 
key role in performing damage assessment in the case of a corrupted system. The 
audit trail shall keep track of all security-relevant events such as the use of 
identification and authentication mechanisms, introduction of objects into a 
user's address space, deletion of objects from the system, system administrator 
actions, and any other events that attempt to violate the security policy of the 
system. The option should exist that either all activities be audited or that 
the system security administrator select the events to be audited. If it is 
decided that all activities should be audited, there are overhead factors to be 
considered. The storage space needed for a total audit would generally require 
more operator maintenance to prevent any loss of data and to provide adequate 
protection. A requirement exists that authorized personnel shall be able to read 
all events recorded on the audit trail. Analysis of the total audit trail would 
be both a difficult and time-consuming task for the administrator. Thus, a 
selection option is required which may be either a pre-selection or 
post-selection option. 
<P>The audit trail information should be sufficient to reconstruct a complete 
sequence of security-relevant events and processes for a system. To do this, the 
audit trail shall contain the following information: date and time of the event, 
user, type of event, success or failure of the event, the origin of the request, 
the name of the object introduced into the user's address space, accessed, or 
deleted from the storage system, and at the B1 class and above, the sensitivity 
determination of the object. 
<P>It should be remembered that the audit trail shall be included in the Trusted 
Computing Base and shall be accorded the same protection as the TCB. The audit 
trail shall be subject to strict access controls. 
<P>An effective audit trail is necessary in order to detect and evaluate hostile 
attacks on a system.

<H1><A name="HDR 2 30"><B>GLOSSARY</B></A></H1>Administrator - Any one of a 
group of personnel assigned to supervise all or a portion of an ADP system. 
<P>Archive - To file or store records off-line. 
<P>
<P>Audit - To conduct the independent review and examination of system records 
and activities. 
<P>Auditor - An authorized individual with administrative duties, whose duties 
include selecting the events to be audited on the system, setting up the audit 
flags which enable the recording of those events, and analyzing the trail of 
audit events.(2) 
<P>Audit Mechanism - The device used to collect, review, and/or examine system 
activities. 
<P>Audit Trail - A set of records that collectively provide documentary evidence 
of processing used to aid in tracing from original transactions forward to 
related records and reports, and/or backwards from records and reports to their 
component source transactions.(1) 
<P>Auditable Event - Any event that can be selected for inclusion in the audit 
trail. These events should include, in addition to security-relevant events, 
events taken to recover the system after failure and any events that might prove 
to be security-relevant at a later time. 
<P>Authenticated User - A user who has accessed an ADP system with a valid 
identifier and authentication combination. 
<P>Automatic Data Processing (ADP) System - An assembly of computer hardware, 
firmware, and software configured for the purpose of classifying, sorting, 
calculating, computing, summarizing, transmitting and receiving, storing, and 
retrieving data with a minimum of human intervention.(1) 
<P>Category - A grouping of classified or unclassified sensitive information, to 
which an additional restrictive label is applied (e.g., proprietary, 
compartmented information) to signify that personnel are granted access to the 
information only if they have formal approval or other appropriate 
authorization.(4) 
<P>Covert Channel - A communication channel that allows a process to transfer 
information in a manner that violates the system's security policy.(1) 
<P>Covert Storage Channel - A covert channel that involves the direct or 
indirect writing of a storage location by one process and the direct or indirect 
reading of the storage location by another process. Covert storage channels 
typically involve a finite resource (e.g., sectors on a disk) that is shared by 
two subjects at different security levels.(1) 
<P>Covert Timing Channel - A covert channel in which one process signals 
information to another by modulating its own use of system resources (e.g., CPU 
time) in such a way that this manipulation affects the real response time 
observed by the second process.(1) 
<P>Flaw - An error of commission, omission or oversight in a system that allows 
protection mechanisms to be bypassed.(1) 
<P>Object - A passive entity that contains or receives information. Access to an 
object potentially implies access to the information it contains. Examples of 
objects are: records, blocks, pages, segments, files, directories, directory 
trees and programs, as well as bits, bytes, words, fields, processors, video 
displays, keyboards, clocks, printers, network nodes, etc.(1) 
<P>Post-Selection - Selection, by authorized personnel, of specified events that 
had been recorded on the audit trail. 
<P>Pre-Selection - Selection, by authorized personnel, of the auditable events 
that are to be recorded on the audit trail. 
<P>Security Level - The combination of a hierarchical classification and a set 
of non-hierarchical categories that represents the sensitivity of 
information.(1) 
<P>Security Policy - The set of laws, rules, and practices that regulate how an 
organization manages, protects, and distributes sensitive information.(1) 
<P>Security-Relevant Event - Any event that attempts to change the security 
state of the system, (e.g., change discretionary access controls, change the 
security level of the subject, change user password, etc.). Also, any event that 
attempts to violate the security policy of the system, (e.g., too many attempts 
to login, attempts to violate the mandatory access control limits of a device, 
attempts to downgrade a file, etc.).(1) 
<P>Sensitive Information - Information that, as determined by a competent 
authority, must be protected because its unauthorized disclosure, alteration, 
loss, or destruction will at least cause perceivable damage to someone or 
something.(1) 
<P>Subject - An active entity, generally in the form of a person, process, or 
device that causes information to flow among objects or changes the system 
state. Technically, a process/domain pair.(1) 
<P>Subject Sensitivity Level - The sensitivity level of the objects to which the 
subject has both read and write access. A subject's sensitivity level must 
always be less than or equal to the clearance of the user the subject is 
associated with.(4) 
<P>System Security Administrator - The person responsible for the security of an 
Automated Information System and having the authority to enforce the security 
safeguards on all others who have access to the Automated Information System.(4) 

<P>Trusted Computing Base (TCB) - The totality of protection mechanisms within a 
computer system -- including hardware, firmware, and software -- the combination 
of which is responsible for enforcing a security policy. A TCB consists of one 
or more components that together enforce a unified security policy over a 
product or system. The ability of a TCB to correctly enforce a security policy 
depends solely on the mechanisms within the TCB and on the correct input by 
system administrative personnel of parameters (e.g., a user's clearance) related 
to the security policy.(1) 
<P>User - Any person who interacts directly with a computer system.(1)
