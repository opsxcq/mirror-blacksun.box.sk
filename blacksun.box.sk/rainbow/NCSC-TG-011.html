<H2><A name="HDR 2 16">FOREWORD</A></H2>The National Computer Security Center is 
issuing the Trusted Network Interpretation Environments Guideline as part of our 
Technical Guidelines Program, through which the "Rainbow Series" is produced. 
The Technical Guidelines Program ensures that the features of the Trusted 
Computer Systems Evaluation Criteria (DOD 5200.28-STD) are discussed in detail 
and that guidance is provided for meeting each requirement. The National 
Computer Security Center, through its Trusted Product Evaluation Program, 
analyses the security features of commercially produced and supported computer 
systems. Together, these programs ensure that organisations are capable of 
protecting their important data with trusted computer systems.
<P>The Trusted Network Interpretation Environments Guideline is a companion to 
the Trusted Network Interpretation of the. Trusted Computer System Evaluation 
Criteria (NCSC-TG~O5), published 31 July 1987. The Trusted Network 
Interpretation Environments Guideline provides insight into the issues relevant 
when integrating, operating, and maintaining trusted computer networks. This 
document identifies the minimum security protection required in different 
network environments such that network certifiers, integrators, and accreditors 
can determine what protection mechanisms and assurances are minimally required 
in specific network environments.
<P>This document parallels Computer Security Requirements - Guidance for 
Applying the Department of Defense Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria 
in Specific Environments (CDC-STD~O3-85) and its technical rationale (CSC 
STD~0485). It also provides a descriptive presentation of the security issues 
that exist in networked computer systems as the networked computer system 
environment is inherently more complex and requires additional protection 
considerations over stand-alone computer systems.
<P>As the Director, National Computer Security Center, I invite you suggestions 
for revising this document. We plan to review this document as the need arises.

<H2><A name="HDR1   2 18">1 Introduction</A></H2>This Trusted Network 
Interpretation (TNI) Environments Guideline (TNIEG) addresses many issues in 
determining the security protection required in different network environments. 
It complements the TNI, just as the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria 
(TCSEC) Environments Guideline [1] complements the TCSEC. The TNI interprets the 
TCSEC for networks; it contains all of the criteria in the TCSEC, adding 
interpretation and rationale to applying trust technology to network systems. In 
the same way that the TCSEC Environments Guideline provides guidance on applying 
the TCSEC, this TNIEG provides guidance on the use of the TNI. The TCSEC and its 
Environments Guideline constitute the foundation on which the TNI and TNIEG add 
network applicability.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR1.1   3 18">1.1 Background</A></H3>The National Computer 
Security Center (NCSC) is responsible for establishing and maintaining technical 
standards and criteria for the evaluation of trusted computer systems. As part 
of this responsibility, the NCSC is developing guidance on how new security 
technology should be used. Two objectives of this guidance are:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Establishing a metric for categorizing systems according to the security 
  protection they provide, and<BR>
  <LI>Identifying the minimum security protection required in different 
  environments.<BR></LI></UL>The TCSEC [2] helps to satisfy the first objective by 
categorizing computer systems into hierarchical classes based on evaluation of 
their security features and assurances. The TCSEC Environments Guideline [1] 
helps to satisfy the second objective by identifying the minimum classes 
appropriate for systems in different risk environments. These two documents, 
however, apply to stand-alone computer systems.
<P>The TNI [3] satisfies the first objective by interpreting the TCSEC for 
networks. The TNI also provides guidance for selecting and specifying other 
security services (e.g., communications integrity, denial of service, 
transmission security). The TNIEG is the first step toward addressing the second 
objective.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR1.2   3 19">1.2 Trusted Network Technology 
Publications</A></H3>The NCSC has decided to provide guidance concerning 
security in networks and distributed Automated Information Systems (AISs)1 in a 
series of publications. The subject area is collectively identified as Trusted 
Network Technology (TNT). The TNI is the first TNT publication. This TNIEG is 
the second TNT publication. It contains the best guidance that is available at 
this time; as technology advances and more experience is gained in implementing 
trusted networks, more specific guidance will be provided. This TNIEG provides 
elaboration and clarification on the TNI. Guidance concerning Interconnected AIS 
which initially appeared in the TNI, Appendix C, has been revised and 
incorporated into this document (see Section 6 and Appendix A). This document 
does not address all of the security issues that are excluded from the TNI. 
Other topics, such as composing a trusted system from evaluated components, will 
be discussed in future TNT publications.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR1.3   3 19">1.3 Purpose</A></H3>The overall purpose of this 
TNIEG is to assist program managers, integrators, certifiers, and Accreditors 
with identifying the minimum security protection needed for different trusted 
computer network environments. For brevity, this audience is referred to as 
security managers. Not all questions can be answered at this time. The NCSC 
invites suggestions for topics to be addressed in future TNT publications.
<P>This guideline is not a tutorial on security and networking; it is assumed 
that the reader will have some background in both areas. Suggested background 
references are identified in Appendix B. This guideline is designed to be self 
contained; a fair amount of background information that can be found in the TNI 
is also included here. The interested reader may consult the TNI and other 
documents referenced in this guideline for further detail.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR1.4   3 19">1.4 Scope</A></H3>This document describes an 
environmental assessment process that helps determine the minimum level of trust 
recommended for a specific network operational environment. The primary focus of 
this document (and also of the TNI) is on the AIS
<P>
<DL compact>
  <DT>1 Definitions of terms particularly important to this document are given 
  in Section 2. 
  <DT>hardware, firmware, and software aspects of security; therefore, neither 
  this guideline nor the TNI address all the security requirements that may be 
  imposed on a network. Depending on the particular environment, communications 
  security (COMSEC), emanations security (TEMPEST), physical security, personnel 
  security, administrative security, and other information security (INFOSEC) 
  measures or safeguards are also required. This document applies to networks 
  that are entrusted with the processing of information, regardless of whether 
  that information is classified, sensitive, or otherwise relevant to national 
  security. </DT></DL>
<H3><A name="HDR1.5   3 20">1.5 Structure of the Document</A></H3>Section 2 of 
this document defines terms and Section 3 discusses Network Security 
Architecture and Design. Section 4 guides security managers in applying Part I 
of the TNI; Section 5 does the same for Part II. Section 6 addresses security 
issues that arise when AIS are interconnected. Appendix A discusses the Cascade 
Condition in greater detail; Appendix B provides tutorial and background 
references on network security; and Appendix C discusses encryption and 
encryption mechanisms.
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR2   2 20">2 Terminology</A></H2>Many of the terms used in the 
TNI are drawn from diverse specialization areas. Their special meaning in 
context may differ from common English usage. In this section we explain how 
such terms are used in the TNI and how these definitions have been refined in 
this document. Terms are printed in boldface when they are defined.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR2.1   3 20">2.1 Automated Information System</A></H3>An AIS is 
defined in DODD 5200.28 as "an assembly of computer hardware, software, and/or 
firmware configured to collect, create, communicate, compute, disseminate, 
process, store, and/or control data or information" [4]. This is both a broad 
definition and a new one, since DODD 5200.28 was published after the TNI. The 
TNI states that "automatic data processing (ADP) systems, referred to in this 
[TNI] document as Automated Information System (AIS)...", and equates AIS and 
ADP. We will use the DODD 5200.28 definition since it is broader and more 
authoritative. We also note that DODD 5200.28 tends to pluralize AIS as AISs 
while the TNI considers AIS to be a collective noun. We have followed the latter 
convention.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR2.2   3 21">2.2 Network Trusted Computing Base</A></H3>The 
Network Trusted Computing Base (NTCB) is the totality of protection mechanisms 
within a network system2-including hardware, firmware, and software- the 
combination of which is responsible for enforcing a security policy. The NTCB is 
the network generalization of the trusted computing base (TCB). An NTCB 
Partition is the totality of mechanisms within a single network subsystem3 for 
enforcing the network policy, as allocated to that subsystem; it is the part of 
the NTCB within a single network subsystem.
<P>2~e distinction between a system and a subsystem is a matter of the viewpoint 
of the observer. One observer's system may be another observer's subsystem. For 
example, the vendor of a local area network may regard his product as a system, 
while the customer's network architect may consider it to be a subsystem along 
with hosts, workstations, etc. 
<P>~e THI uses component in the definition of NTCB Partition. We use subsystem 
to be consistent in this document.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR2.3   3 21">2.3 System and Component</A></H3>The terms system 
add component need to be related to each other. Unfortunately, the TNI is not 
completely consistent in its use of these terms. We will first cite the relevant 
sections from the TNI; then we will reconcile them as used in this guideline. As 
discussed below, we define the relationship as follows: A component is a 
physical unit contained within a system.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR2.3.1   4 21">2.3.1 TNI Introduction (definition not used in 
TNIEG)</A></H4>The TNI Introduction states (emphasis added):
<P>
<DL>
  <DD>A network system is the entire collection of hardware, firmware, and 
  software necessary to provide a desired functionality. A component is any part 
  of a system that, taken by itself, provides all or a portion of the total 
  functionality required of a system. A component is recursively defined to be 
  an individual unit, not useful to further subdivide, or a collection of 
  components up to and including the entire system.<BR></DD></DL>
<H4><A name="HDR2.3.2   4 21">2.3.2 TNI - Appendix A (definition not used in 
TNIEG)</A></H4>Appendix A of the TNI presents the view:
<P>
<DL>
  <DD>a trusted network represents a composition of trusted components....<BR>
  <DD>The approach to evaluation of a network suggested by this view is to 
  partition the system into components, rate each component to determine its 
  security-relevant characteristics, and then evaluate the composition of the 
  components to arrive at an overall rating class for the network. This 
  approach... allows for the evaluation of components which in and of themselves 
  do not support all the policies required by the TCSEC, ... contribute[s] to 
  the overall evaluation of any network which uses them and allows for the reuse 
  of the evaluated component in different networks without the need for a 
  re-evaluation of the component.<BR></DD></DL>Appendix A goes on to state that:
<P>
<DL>
  <DD>The set of policy-related features to be supported by the component need 
  not be the complete set required for a stand-alone system: features not 
  supplied by one component for the system are supplied by another.<BR></DD></DL>
<H4><A name="HDR2.3.3   4 22">2.3.3 Discussion</A></H4>We see a difference 
between the Introduction and Appendix A of the TNI. We will use the definition 
of component as an individual unit that does not provide a complete set of 
end-user services. As a consequence, a subsystem can operate on its own and a 
component will require an external connection to perform a useful function.
<P>Appendix C of the TNI uses component, as follows, where we would use 
subsystem:
<P>
<DL>
  <DD>Any AIS that is connected to other AIS must enforce an "Interconnection 
  Rule" that limits the sensitivity levels of information that it may send or 
  receive. Using the component connection view, each component responsible for 
  maintaining the separation of multiple levels of information must decide 
  locally whether or not information ca be sent or received.<BR></DD></DL>A 
component may support all the policy and accountability requirements: M, D, I, 
ad A4; however, as defined above, this is not applicable to determining whether 
an individual unit is a component. A component which supports some part of the 
security policy contains an NTCB partition. In the extreme, a component may not 
have any security-relevant function; in this case it doesn't support any TCSEC 
policy and doesn't contain an NTCB partition.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR2.3.4   4 23">2.3.4 Definitions</A></H4>To summarize the 
previous discussions, following are definitions for component ad 
system/subsystem.
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Component: An individual physical unit that does not provide a complete 
  set of end-user services.<BR>
  <LI>System/subsystem: A collection of hardware, firmware, and software 
  necessary configured to collect, create, communicate, compute, disseminate 
  process, store, and/or control data ad information [4].<BR></LI></UL>
<H3><A name="HDR2.4   3 23">2.4 Evaluation</A></H3>NCSC-evaluation refers 
specifically to the process in which the NCSC determines whether a 
commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) product satisfies the TCSE~C. Application of the 
TCSEC to a particular product may be assisted by an interpretation guideline 
such as the TNI [5]. In such a case, the guideline clarifies the meaning of the 
TCSEC's language with regard to a particular type of product, but in no case 
circumvents or grants exception to the requirements of the TCSEC. The purpose of 
an NCSC- evaluation is as follows:
<P>
<DL>
  <DD>The primary goal of the NCSC is to encourage the widespread availability 
  of trusted computer systems. This goal is realized, in large measure, through 
  the NCSC's Commercial Product Evaluation Program. This program is focused on 
  the technical evaluation of the protection capabilities of off-the- shelf, 
  commercially produced and supported systems that meet the computer security 
  needs of government departments and agencies. This product evaluation 
  culminates in the publication of an Evaluated Products List (EPL) report... 
  [6].<BR></DD></DL>An NCSC evaluation places a product in one of four divisions: 
D, C, B, or A. Division D is for systems that have been evaluated but fail to 
meet the requirements for a higher NCSC evaluation rating. Division C has two 
classes: C1 and C2, which require discretionary (need-to-know) protection. 
Division B has three classes: B1, B2, and B3, which require support for 
sensitivity labels and increasing robustness of system architecture. Division A 
has only class Al, which requires additional assurance through formal 
verification methods.

  and authentication, and audit, respectively. </DT></DL>
<H3><A name="HDR2.5   3 24">2.5 Certification</A></H3>Certification is defined 
as "the technical evaluation of a system's security features, made as part of 
and in support of the approval/accreditation process, that establishes the 
extent to which a particular system's design and implementation meet a set of 
specified security requirements" [7]. In this definition, the word evaluation is 
used in the generic sense and should not be confused with NCSC evaluation. The 
primary distinction is that certification is an evaluation with respect to 
specified requirements, and NCSC evaluation is an evaluation against the TCSEC 
(and the TNI).
<P>Certification is conducted in support of the accreditation decision. For most 
systems, the hardware, system software, applications software, communications 
equipment, and the operational facility must be configured and tested during 
certification. Certification should be performed by technical personnel 
independent of the development organization, according to an acceptable 
methodology. Certification should identify the level of security protection with 
regard to a procedure, program, or system. Certification results in the issuance 
of the Certification Statement, which states whether system security 
requirements are met, describes all known remaining vulnerabilities, and advises 
the Accreditor relative to the accreditation decision. If requirements are no 
met, the Certification Statement lists problem areas and identifies suggested 
solutions (if known). A certification documentation package, called the 
Certification Report of Findings, submitted to the Accreditor includes the 
Certification Statement, certification analysis, results of Security Test and 
Evaluation, id results of Operational Test and Evaluation.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR2.6   3 24">2.6 Accreditation</A></H3>Accreditation is "the 
managerial authorization and approval granted to an ADP system or network to 
process sensitive data in an operational environment, made on the basis of a 
certification by designated technical personnel..." [3]. Accreditation is a 
management decision to operate a system or network employing specific 
safeguards, against a defined threat, at an acceptable level of risk, under a 
stated operational concept, with stated interconnections, in a specific 
operational environment, with a specific security mode of operation. Other terms 
have been used to identify the formal managerial approval for operation; in this 
document we use the term Accreditation. FIPS PUB 102 defines Accrediting 
Officials as "the agency officials who have authority to accept an application's 
security safeguards and issue an accreditation statement that records that 
decision. The Accrediting Officials must also possess authority to allocate 
resources to achieve acceptable security and to remedy security deficiencies" 
[7]. The ultimate responsibility for system security rests with the Accreditor. 
DODD 5200.28 employs the term Designated Approving Authority (DAA) to refer to 
the same officials or officers [4].
<P>All AIS must be accredited before they may process or use sensitive or 
classified information, unless a written waiver is granted by the Accreditor. 
Accreditation is based on a technical investigation and a formal review of the 
certification Report of Findings. Before authorizing an AIS to operate, the 
Accreditor must ensure that satisfactory security measures have been installed 
and that any residual risk is within acceptable limits. Often, the Accreditor 
must weigh the technical shortcomings of an AIS against operational necessity. 
Lacking other ways to accomplish an operational mission, the Accreditor may 
determine that it is preferable to accept a residual security risk than to 
preclude the mission. To ensure that the accreditation goals and objectives are 
adequately met, the Accreditor must be involved throughout the system life 
cycle.

<H3><A name="HDR2.7   3 25">2.7 Two Types of Networks</A></H3>A network may be 
defined as either an interconnection of accredited AIS or as a Unified Network. 
When it is not necessary to differentiate in this guideline, the term network is 
used.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR2.7.1   4 25">2.7.1 Unified Networks</A></H4>The TNI defines a 
Network Single Trusted System while DODD 5200.28 Enclosure (5) defines a Unified 
Network; this TNIEG conforms to the latter usage. The section of Enclosure (5) 
that addresses <B>Unified Networks is brief and instructive 5:</B>
<P>
<DL>
  <DD>Some networks may be accredited as a whole without prior accreditation of 
  their component AIS. It is necessary to treat a network as unified when some 
  of its AIS subsystems are so specialized or dependent on other subsystems of 
  the network for security support that individual accreditation of such 
  subsystems is not possible or meaningful with respect to secure network 
  operation. In order to be accredited, a Unified Network shall possess a 
  coherent network architecture and design, and it should be developed with an 
  attention to security requirements, mechanisms, and assurances commensurate 
  with the range of sensitivity of information for which it is to be 
  accredited.<BR>
  <DD>The recommended approach for accrediting a Unified Network is to apply 
  Enclosure 4 to the entire network to derive an evaluation class. Requirements 
  to meet that evaluation class then are obtained from an applicable 
  interpretation of DOD5200.28-STD [the TCSEC], such as NCSC- TG~05 [the 
  TNI].<BR></DD></DL>

  restrictions and limitations are observed for connections between DOD 
  Component AIS. ... In particular, connections between accredited AIS must be 
  consistent with the mode of operation of each AIS, the specific sensitivity 
  level or range of sensitivity levels for which each AIS is accredited, any 
  additional interface constraints associated with the particular interface 
  device used for the connection, and any other restrictions required by the 
  MOA.<BR></DD></DL>---------------------------
<P>5 As mentioned in the introduction and the definitions, this TNIEG differs 
from DODD 5200.28 and the TNI in the usage of AIS and the definition of 
component. This quotation has been slightly edited to conform to the usage in 
this guideline. she content of a Memorandum of Agreement is discussed in Section 
3.2
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR2.8   3 27">2.8 Network Security Architecture and 
Design</A></H3><B>Network Security Architecture and Design (NSAD) applies to all 
networks. The NSAD identifies how the NTCB is partitioned and how the trusted 
system requirements are met. Security engineering, including the development of 
the NSAD, is a specialty area within systems engineering. The security engineer 
is responsible for ensuring that the system being built meets the security 
requirements of the organization. The security engineer ensures that the AIS 
security conforms to applicable regulations and policy, and implements the 
system security requirements [8].</B>
<P>The security policy includes the set of laws, rules, and practices that 
govern how an organization manages, protects, and distributes sensitive 
information (including classified information). The overall security policy is 
addressed in a family of related documents consisting of a system security 
policy, a security policy model, and security requirements. The system security 
policy is developed first, followed by the other two. A system security policy 
interprets and applies regulations to systems. The security policy model defines 
subjects and objects and the accesses between the two. The security requirements 
document identifies valuable user requirements for a secure system.
<P>The security architecture is that part of the system architecture that 
describes the required security services and features. The security architecture 
shows how the required level of assurance for the system is to be met. A mapping 
of security requirements to functional elements is documented in the security 
architecture; therefore, the security architecture is used to document security 
design decisions.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR2.9   3 27">2.9 Protocol Layer Approach</A></H3>This guideline 
discusses networks in terms of the Open System Interconnection (0SI) reference 
model [9] because that model provides a well-understood terminology and is used 
in the TNI. This guideline, however, is independent of the actual protocol 
reference model used.
<P>An NTCB implementation need not include all protocol layers. The precise 
security services and their granularity will depend on the highest protocol 
layer at which an NTCB partition is implemented.7 For example, in a Unified 
Network where layer 3 (the network layer) is the highest layer that implements 
the NTCB, the network will be able to enforce mandatory access control (MAC) and 
discretionary access control (DAC) decisions on the granularity of network 
addresses8. The network system being evaluated knows only about the range of 
classifications that the host (or other network) is permitted to handle and the 
hosts (or other networks) that are permitted to communicate with each other. 
Finer distinctions must be made by the hosts (or other networks) involved. When 
a trusted network provides all seven layers, the network is aware of and 
enforces MAC and DAC at the granularity of individual users.
<P>A network device might not provide a complete set of end-user services 
through layer 7. Products that do not provide all system services through layer 
7 may be NCSC-evaluated as components and subsequently used with other 
components to compose a network.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR2.10   3 28">2.10 Part II Security Services</A></H3>The terms 
functionality, strength of mechanism, and assurance are used to rate TNI Part II 
services. Their meanings in that context are described below.
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><B>Functionality refers to the objective and approach of a security 
  service; it includes features, mechanism, and performance. Alternative 
  approaches to achieving the desired functionality may be more suitable in 
  different applications environments.</B><BR>
  <DD><B>Strength of mechanism refers to how well a specific approach may be 
  expected to achieve its objectives. In some cases the selection of parameters, 
  such as number of bits used in a checksum or the number of permutations used 
  in an encryption algorithm, can significantly affect strength of mechanism. 
  With regard to inadvertent threats, strength refers to the ability to operate 
  correctly during natural disasters, emergencies, operator errors, and 
  accidents. Inadvertent threats are particularly critical to prevention of 
  denial of service. As an example, for communications line outages, strength of 
  mechanism may refer to the number of alternate routes that maybe used to 
  bypass the outage. The misdelivery of messages is an example of an inadvertent 
  threat that may disclose information to unauthorized individuals. Encryption 
  can be used to prevent the unintended recipient from seeing the 
  information.</B><BR>
  <DD><B>Assurance refers to a basis for believing that the functionality will 
  be achieved; it includes tamper resistance, verifiability, and resistance 
  against circumvention or bypass. Assurance is generally based on analysis 
  involving theory, testing, software engineering, validation and verification, 
  and related approaches. The analysis may be formal or 
informal.</B><BR></DD></DL>______________________

"User", as defined in DODD 5200.28, ad peer.entity, as defined in the 051

the 051 architecture.
<P>8 A network address refers to either a host or another network.
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR3   2 29">3 Network Security Architecture and Design 
(NSAD)</A></H2>Every network should have a Network Security Architecture and 
Design (NSAD). This section helps the security manager in establishing the NSAD 
for the network.
<P>The NSAD, produced as part of the risk management process, documents the 
security services. As mentioned in Section 1, the primary focus of this TNIEG is 
on the AIS aspects of security. Depending on the particular environment, 
communications security (COMSEC), emanations security (TEMPEST), physical 
security, personnel security, administrative security, and other information 
security (INFOSEC) measures or safeguards are also incorporated in the NSAD. An 
NSAD results from a series of trade-offs among cost, effectiveness, technical 
risk, mission requirements, and risk management.
<P>While the architecture part of the NSAD may be somewhat abstract, the design 
part should be quite concrete. The design maps the selected security services to 
system functional elements9. Next, these functional elements are assigned to 
components and subsystems.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR3.1   3 29">3.1 Composing an NSAD</A></H3>The security manager 
is responsible for ensuring that an NSAD is defined that applies to all the 
components or subsystems that constitute the network. The NSAD for a network 
must address the applicable security-relevant policies and may incorporate the 
NSADs of its constituent components or subsystems. In some cases, such as when a 
component provides part of the functionality of the network (e.g., a local area 
network (LAN) providing 051 layer three communication services), the NSAD of the 
component may be incorporated with little or no change into the NSAD for the 
network. The component NSAD will probably require some modification to address 
the applicable policy and environment constraints.
<P>___________________
<P>9 Sections 4 and 5 of this document should guide the security manager in 
selecting those security services and safeguards that are appropriate for the 
given operational environment.
<P>A typical network configuration will include multiple vendor's products. When 
the network is created, the security manager must reconcile the diverse NSADs of 
the constituents into a coherent NSAD for the configured network and identify 
any restrictions or new security services and assurance that must be added. The 
NSAD must implement national, service, and command policies for the environment 
in which the network will operate. The same process applies when previously 
accredited AIS are to be interconnected to support the exchange of information.
<P>In contrast to the networks described above, when a network is created from 
scratch, the NSAD may be established before any devices are selected and may be 
included as part of the criteria for selecting the network devices.
<P>Note that the network may include components that are not security-relevant 
and, therefore, do not have a component NSAD. The design decisions that result 
in the inclusion of non-security-relevant components are documented in the NSAD.
<P>AIS may be combined into a network under conditions of a hierarchical 
relationship of their security managers. In this case the NSAD of the 
subordinate system must conform to the governing NSAD. For example, when a host 
computer connects to a common user network, the host computer must conform to 
the NSAD established by the security manager of the common user network, who has 
a responsibility to the security managers of all other connected AIS to maintain 
the network's trustworthiness. As discussed below, this conformance is recorded 
in a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA).
<P>AIS whose security managers are not hierarchically related may also be 
combined to form a network. In this case, the security managers come to 
agreement on the NSAD for the network; this agreement is also recorded in an 
MOA.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR3.2   3 30">3.2 Memorandum of Agreement</A></H3>If a network 
consists of previously accredited AIS, a MOA is required between the Accreditors 
for each subsystem. This MOA is part of the documentation of the NSAD. The MOA 
discusses the accreditation requirements for each subsystem that is to be 
interconnected to form the network [4], i.e., defines all the terms and 
conditions of the security arrangements that will govern the operation of the 
network [10]. The objective of the MOA is to document the interconnection 
requirements and identify any requirements that may be necessary to provide 
overall security safeguards for the entire network. This network includes all 
the interconnected subsystems, the communications devices, the users, and the 
data stored in the subsystem [10]. A Memorandum of Record (MOR) is used when the 
subsystems have the same Accreditor. A comprehensive M0A10 could constitute the 
entire NSAD for a network; alternatively, the MOA could contain high level 
agreements, with the details spelled out in supporting documents. Following is a 
list of suggestions for the contents of the MOA and supporting documents. The

<H2><A name="HDR4   2 32">4 TNI Part I Security Requirements</A></H2>This 
section assists the security manager in determining the recommended minimum 
security requirements based on TNI Part I and Appendix A, which interprets the 
TCSEC for networks.
<P>The procedure for determining the minimum security requirements for a network 
parallels the procedure for a stand-alone system, whereby the highest 
classification of data and the lowest clearance among system users are used in 
computing a risk index. The risk index is used to determine which NCSC 
evaluation rating is required of the system to provide adequate security. To 
emphasize, these are the minimum requirements. The TCSEC Environments Guideline 
does not address environmental factors such as the number of users and the 
percentage of users at different classification levels. These factors may become 
more significant in a network environment. Communications security risk in a 
network is addressed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and other cognizant 
organizations and results in a set of recommendations for the appropriate 
equipment or security procedures. Other factors, such as the number of 
connections, the physical distance between devices, the number of subsystems, 
the presence of encryption, and the possible presence of intervening systems 
between the resources being used and the ultimate user may result in more or 
less stringent requirements.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.1   3 32">4.1 Risk Management</A></H3>Risk management is a 
methodology used to identify, measure, and control events which adversely affect 
security; it involves cost-benefit analyses to ensure appropriate 
cost-effectiveness of security safeguards. A risk management program is mandated 
by Enclosure (3) of DODD 5200.28.
<P>The literature on risk management is quite extensive. It is not the;Purpose 
of this document to survey the field. The interested reader is referred to FIPS 
PUB 65 [11]. The literature is constantly growing; a recent high-level 
introduction to general concepts and terminology can be found in Bell [12] and 
in the Proceedings of the First Invitational Workshop on Computer Security Risk 
Management [13].
<P>DODD 5200.28 Enclosure (4) mandates the use of a methodology, extracted from 
the TCSEC Environments Guideline, to determine the recommended evaluation 
class(or requirements of an evaluation class) based on a specific environment. 
Enclosure (5) of the Directive also recommends this method to determine minimum 
computer-based requirements in a network. This guideline also uses that method. 
Use of a different method requires prior approval of the Assistant Secretary of 
Defense (ASD) Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C<EM 
sup>31).</EM>
<P>
<P>DODD 5200.28 Enclosure (4) contains six major steps in the risk assessment 
procedure. These steps are listed below. DODD 5200.28 Enclosure (4) applies in 
all steps.
<P><B>Step 1. Determine system security mode of operation.</B>
<P><B>Step 2. Determine minimum user clearance or authorization rating.</B>

<P><B>Step 6. Determine adjustments to computer security evaluation class

<P>An elaboration of step six given in Migues [14], involving a detailed 
analysis of both environmental and architectural risk factors, is based on 
Landwehr and Lubbes[15]. It presents a method which incorporates analysis of the 
applications environment. This analysis includes such factors as whether the 
system allows programming, or whether it is restricted to a limited set of 
applications. This more detailed information supports a finer determination of

financial sums or critical mission-sensitive data), a higher rating may be 
warranted. This table prescribes minimum ratings.
<P>5 The rating increment between the Secret and Top Secret data sensitivity 
levels is greater than the increment between other adjacent levels. This 
difference derives from the fact that the loss of Top Secret data causes

<H2><A name="HDR5   2 38">5 TNI Part II Security Requirements</A></H2>This 
section contains a discussion of TNI Part II which describes qualitative 
evaluations of security services in terms of functionality, strength of 
mechanism, and assurance. Part II of the TNI describes additional security 
concerns and services that arise in conjunction with networks, but that do not 
normally arise in stand-alone computers.
<P>Part II of the TNI focuses on those threats that occur between end systems 
(hosts) on the network. These security services include protection against 
compromise, denial of service, and unauthorized modification. In discussing 
these services, the TNI borrows heavily from the International Standards 
Organization (150) 051 Basic Reference Model [9] and Security Architecture [16]. 
The services discussed are closely related to those found in the latter 
reference. The TNI goes beyond the 051 Security Architecture in several 
respects. First, the 051 document does not address the relative strengths of 
different mechanisms nor the assurances that they operate as intended. Second, 
the protection against denial of service threats is not specifically addressed 
by 051 but is an important consideration in the TNI.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR5.1   3 38">5.1 Relationship of TNI Part II Services to Part I 
and Appendix A</A></H3>The Part II services are not as well understood as the 
features in TN1 Part I. The fact that Part 11 services have not been supported 
by equally well developed theories and detailed evaluation criteria should not 
be interpreted to imply that their security problems do not have to be evaluated 
as rigorously as TNI Part I and Appendix A services. Some Part II services may 
not be part of the NTCB. For example, to make the NTCB as small as possible, 
some of the protocol software may be outside the NTCB. Therefore, the 
protocol-based protection against denial of service is likely to be outside the 
NTCB. Nonetheless, it must rely on some of the fundamental NTCB assurances since 
the protocols invoke portions of the subsystem's operating system.
<P>It is important to recognize that many Part II security services depend on 
(embedded) AIS. These AIS should be evaluated using Part I and Appendix A of the 
TNI. Encryption systems, for example, are highly dependent upon AIS; they are 
addressed in Appendix B of the TNI and Appendix C of this guideline. Appendix C 
presents some considerations concerned with applying Tables 1, 2, and 3 to 
encryption systems.
<P>For security services that do not depend strongly on A!S, a qualitative 
evaluation approach is used. For functionality, a question and answer format is 
presented in Section 5.4.3. For strength of mechanism and assurance, the concept 
of a risk index is used in Sections 5.4.1 and 5.4.2.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR5.2   3 39">5.2 Specification and Evaluation of Security 
Services</A></H3>Specifying and evaluating Part II security services is quite 
different from a TN! Part! evaluation even though both parts are concerned with 
the same three aspects of security services or capabilities: functionality, 
strength of mechanism, and assurance. For clarity these terms are defined as 
follows:
<P>
<DL>
  <DL>
    <DD><B>Functionality refers to the objective and approach of a security 
    service.</B><BR>
    <DD><B>Strength of mechanism refers to how well a specific approach may be 
    expected to achieve its objectives.</B><BR>
    <DD><B>Assurance refers to a basis for believing that the functionality will 
    be achieved.</B><BR></DD></DL></DL>
<H3><A name="HDR5.3   3 39">5.3 Evaluation Ratings</A></H3>Part II evaluations 
are qualitative, as compared with the hierarchically ordered ratings (e.g., C1, 
C2, ...) from the TCSEC. The results of a Part II evaluation for offered 
services are generally summarized using the terms none, minimum, fair, and good. 
For some services, functionality is summarized using none or present because 
gradations are not meaningful. The term none is used to mean the security 
service fails to distinguish the strength of mechanism. The term not offered is 
used when a security service is not offered. For example, if a certain network 
did not include non- repudiation as one of its security services, that network 
would be rated not offered with respect to non-repudiation. Table 4 represents 
the evaluation structure of Part II as a matrix. It identifies a set of security 
services. It also shows the possible evaluation ranges for each service in terms 
of its functionality, strength of mechanism, and assurance.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR5.4   3 39">5.4 Selecting Security Services</A></H3>Part II 
enumerates representative security services that an organization may choose to 
employ in a specific situation. Not all security services will be equally 
important for a specific environment, nor will their relative importance be the 
same

  <DT>among different environments. Selecting security services is a management 
  decision, with assistance provided by this guideline. </DT></DL>Ordinarily, the 
security manager would first determine whether a particular service is required 
and what functionality is needed (if there are distinctions) through a series of 
questions provided in Section 5.4.3. A separate set of questions is provided for 
each service shown in Table 4.
<P>Once the functionality has been determined, the strength of mechanism and 
appropriate level of assurance must be determined. The process is similar to the 
determination of Part I risk in Section 4 of this guideline. Since the strength 
of mechanism and assurance determination do not differ for the various services, 
these topics are addressed first.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR5.4.1   4 41">5.4.1 Strength of Mechanism</A></H4>Determination 
of strength of mechanism for each service has two components. The inadvertent 
threat and the malicious threat should be analyzed separately. In many cases, 
the malicious threat will dominate the inadvertent threat; malicious users can 
often duplicate the circumstances of an inadvertent threat. The required 
strength of mechanism is determined using a risk index similar to that used in 
Part I.
<P>For inadvertent threats, traditional risk management techniques are used. 
While some countermeasures may be the same for inadvertent and malicious 
threats, others may be effective only against the former. The security manager 
must determine the likelihood of a particular threat, the dollar cost of a 
countermeasure, and the residual risk if the countermeasure is put into effect. 
The manager concerned with these inadvertent threats is referred to the 
references on risk assessment previously cited.
<P>For malicious threats, we consider the most sensitive information contained 
on the system and the lowest clearance of user who can gain physical access to 
some device in the system, including access to wireless transmissions. Some 
devices in the system may be physically protected in buildings that require a 
clearance for admittance. Other devices in the system, such as long-haul 
transmission lines, may have no physical protection.
<P>Protection of the information in the network system is a combination of 
physical, administrative, procedural, and technical protections. The TNIl is 
concerned only with the AIS hardware, firmware, software, and configuration 
management protections. Various service or agency regulations describe methods 
for implementing the other protections.
<P>The various devices in the system must be considered separately; for each 
device, the risk index will be based on the most sensitive information on the 
network system and the minimum clearance to gain physical access to the device. 
Note that this is different from the Part I risk index calculation (where the 
lowest cleared user is of concern). For some devices in the system (e.g., the 
communications media), the clearance of individuals with physical access may be 
lower than that for authorized users. For convenience, all the necessary tables 
are included here. Table 5, Minimum Clearance for Physical Access, is identical 
to Table 1. For each device in the system, the lowest clearance of individuals 
with physical access to that device is used. Table 6 for Maximum Data 
Sensitivity is identical to Table 2.

</PRE>1 Where the number of categories is large or where a highly sensitive 
category is involved, a higher rating might be warranted.
<P>2 The only categories of concern are those for which some users are not 
authorized access. When counting the number of categories, count all categories 
regardless of the sensitivity level associated with the data. If a category is 
associated with more than one sensitivity level, it is only counted at the 
highest level. Systems in which all data are in the same category are treated as 
without categories.
<P>3 Unclassified data by definition may not contain categories.
<P>4 Examples of N data include financial, proprietary, privacy, and 
mission-sensitive data. In some situations (e.g., those involving extremely 
large financial sums or critical mission-sensitive data), a higher rating may be 
warranted. This table prescribes minimum ratings.
<P>5 The rating increment between the Secret and Top Secret data sensitivity 
levels is greater than the increment between other adjacent levels. This 
difference derives from the fact that the loss of Top Secret data causes 
EXCEPTIONALLY GRAVE damage to U.S. national security, whereas the loss of Secret

<H4><A name="HDR5.4.2   4 44">5.4.2 Assurance</A></H4>Assurance is a very 
important concept in the TCSEC and TN!. This section discusses the need for 
assurance and the ways in which it may be achieved.
<P>One salient property of trusted systems is the reliance on a TCB. Similarly, 
trusted network systems rely on an NTCB. In addition to its other 
responsibilities, the NTCB prevents unauthorized modification to objects within 
the network system. In particular, the NTCB maintains the integrity of the 
programs which provide security services, thus ensuring that their assurance is 
continued. The NTCB provides an execution environment that is extremely valuable 
in enhancing the assurance of security services. Discretionary and mandatory 
access controls can be employed to segregate unrelated services. Thus, service 
implementation that is complex and error-prone or obtained from an unevaluated 
supplier can be prevented from degrading the assurance of other services 
implemented in the same device. Furthermore, an NTCB ensures that the basic 
protection of the security and integrity information entrusted to the network is 
not diluted by various supporting security services.
<P>The relationship of the risk index to the required assurance is expressed in 
Table 8.

----------------------
</PRE>Assurance of the design and implementation of Part II mechanisms is also 
related to the assurance requirements in Part I because service integrity 
depends on protection by the NTCB or TCBs. Table 9 expresses this dependency. 
The second column identifies the minimum Part I evaluation which supports the 
Part II assurance requirement. Note that Table 9 is applicable only to those 
Part II services not strongly dependent on A!S; the AIS implementing those 
services can be directly evaluated under Part I and Appendix A of the TNI.
<P>Note that the Evaluation Class calculation in Part I will not necessarily be 
the same as the Minimum Part I Evaluation in Table 9. This is because the Rmin 
for Part II may be different from that of Part I! since the Part II! protections 
are oriented towards outsiders (those with physical access) rather than towards 
users. Depending on the particular environment, either the Part I! requirement 
or the Part II requirement may dominate. The latter would be the case if a 
system were operated in the system high mode-where all users were cleared to see 
the most sensitive information-but the network was exposed to lower clearance 
individuals.
<P>

<H2><A name="HDR6   2 50">6 Interconnecting AIS</A></H2>The definition of 
Interconnected Accredited AIS recognizes that parts of a network may be 
independently created, managed, and accredited. AIS in different security 
domains 13 generally operate under different security policies, consequently, it 
is difficult to combine them into a Unified Network. For example, AIS operated 
by the U.S. DOD and NATO cannot be combined into a Unified Network, since they 
enforce different policies and do not have a common authority.
<P>Interconnecting systems that support different security domains (e.g., 
classified, sensitive unclassified) adds additional complexity. Exchange of 
information among these different security domains requires identification of 
the markings and protection given to information when transmitted to another 
domain. For example, several evolving approaches to the protection of sensitive 
unclassified information [17] consider "that sensitive information is not part 
of the same hierarchy as classified information".
<P>There are technical criteria for judging the trustworthiness of 
Interconnected Accredited AIS: an Interconnection Rule, which ensures that 
information conveyed between subsystems is labeled properly, and risk factors 
such as propagation of local risk and the cascading problem. These criteria are 
examined in some detail below.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR6.1   3 50">6.1 Agreement Between 
Accreditors</A></H3>Interconnection of AIS between security domains requires a 
documented agreement identifying the interconnection requirements and all 
safeguards. This agreement will have many similarities to the MOA discussed in 
Section 3.2. It will probably have to reconcile different security policies and 
philosophies of protection, identifying the conditions under which specified 
classes of information can be exchanged among domains. In addition to the 
information included in the MOA, this agreement between managers of different 
security domains should address the mappings of policy and countermeasures 
between the domains. In many ways this agreement takes on the character of an 
NSAD for the agreed upon information exchange between domains.
<P>___________
<P>
<DL compact>
  <DT>13 A security domain is a collection of AIS under the control of a single 
  administrator that enforces or operates under a specified policy. There can be 
  sub-domains, (e.g., Army and Air Force are sub-domains under the Department of 
  Defense.) </DT></DL>
<H4><A name="HDR6.1.1   4 51">6.1.1 Accreditation Range</A></H4>An accreditation 
designates a system's mode of operation and range of data sensitivity' levels. 
The accreditation range reflects the Accreditor's judgment on the subsystem's 
ability to exchange information within an acceptable level of risk, with respect 
to its network connections, and in accord with the designated sensitivity 
levels.
<P>The range must be a single level in the case of a system high or dedicated 
device14. If the accreditation range comprises more than a single level, the 
system is trusted to reliably segregate data by level within its accreditation 
range, and label it accurately for transmission over multilevel interfaces. The 
accreditation range will be specified in the MOA. The accreditation range is 
used in determining whether communication between systems is permitted.

<P>As shown in Figure 1, an AIS may contain information at levels that are below 
its accreditation range. For example, a C2 host which contsuns Secret (S) and 
Confidential (C) information, is not trusted to segregate this confidential and 
Secret information. Therefore, it is accredited to operate in system high (SH) 
mode at Secret (the highest sensitivity level of information on the system), and 
its accreditation range is the single level Secret. All exported information 
must be labeled with the system high sensitivity label until there is a manual 
review to assign the information a lower

  <DT>classification level. In contrast, a B3 multilevel secure (MLS) host, 
  which contains Top Secret (TS), Secret, and Confidential information could be 
  assigned an accreditation range equal to the entire set of levels processed. 
  In this case, the label of the exported data is equal to the actual level of 
  the exported data, unless unclassified data is to be exported. </DT></DL>Figure 
2 illustrates the accreditation ranges of two interconnected subsystems. 
Although Subsystem Y is able to separate its three levels of information, it may 
exchange information with Subsystem X only at the S and C levels.

<P>In a network, an accreditation range bounds the sensitivity levels of 
information that may be sent (exported) to or received (imported) from each 
interconnected subsystem15. For example, if a network consists of only dedicated 
and system high subsystems, each subsystem will be assigned single-valued

level).

<P>
<H4><A name="HDR6.1.2   4 53">6.1.2 Device Range</A></H4>A network subsystem is 
typically connected to another subsystem through some kind of 1/0 network 
interface or device (see Figures 3~) ad the same device may provide connection 
to multiple subsystems.
<P>Although a 1/0 device is part of a subsystem, it may be designated to process 
a more restricted set of sensitivity levels than the accreditation rage of the 
subsystem as a whole. This leads to the concept of a device range. Each 1/0 
device in a subsystem that is used to communicate with other subsystems in the 
network must have a device rage. The device rage may be single level, or it may 
be a set of levels (in which case the device is referred to as multilevel), and 
it must be included within the subsystem accreditation range. The TCSEC states 
that "systems that have been evaluated at classes B2 ad above must support 
minimum ad maximum security labels for all multilevel 1/0 devices". The purpose 
of device labels is to document the constraints placed on the security levels of 
information authorized for the devices.
<P>Each physically attached multilevel system (if any) has a minimum ad maximum 
sensitivity level associated with it. A B1 or higher system interconnected to a 
second system must ensure that both imported and exported information is 
contained within appropriate sensitivity levels. Information Transfer 
Restrictions
<P>The following points summarize the discussion on the restrictions imposed on 
information transfer between interconnected devices.
<P>Information exported or imported using a single-level device is labeled 
implicitly by the security level of the device. As shown in Figure 3, any 
information transferred between the single-level (S) devices on Subsystems X and 
Y is implicitly labeled S.
<P>Figure 3
<P>Implicit Labeling
<P>Subsystem X Subsystem Y
<P>Information exported from one multilevel device and imported at another 
multilevel device must be labeled through an agreed-upon protocol, unless it is 
labeled implicitly by using a communications link that always carries a single 
level. For instance, in Figure 4, Secret and Confidential information may be 
transferred between the multilevel devices.
<P>Figure 4
<P>Protocol Labeling
<P>Subsystem X Subsystem Y
<P>Figure5
<P>Compatibility Labeling
<P>Subsystem X Subsystem Y
<P>Information exported at a given security level can be sent only to a 
importing device whose device rage contains that level or a higher level. In 
Figure 5,Subsystem X is allowed to export only Secret information to Subsystem 
Y's multilevel device. Subsystem Y is allowed to export Secret ad Confidential 
information to Subsystem X, because the device rage Subsystem X is TS-S. If the 
importing device rage dominates the exported level, the information is 
implicitly or explicitly relabeled upon receipt at a higher level within the 
importing device range.
<P>Figure 6
<P>Relabeling
<P>Subsystem X Subsystem Y
<P>In Figure 6, Subsystem Y relabels information imported from Subsystem X. The 
information transfer restrictions also permit one-way communication (i.e., no 
acknowledgments) from one device to another whose rages have no level in common, 
as long as each level in the sending device rage is dominated by some level in 
the receiving device rage. It is never permitted to send information at a given 
level to a device whose rage does not contain a dominating level.
<P>In most interconnected subsystems, the bidirectional flow of information is 
permitted. In this environment, the sensitivity level of any transmitted message 
must be within the accreditation range of both the sending and receiving 
systems. In some networks, an additional restriction on information flow may be 
unidirectional communications. This restriction may enhance security. The 
following discussions refer to Figure 7.
<P>Figure 7
<P>Bidirectional and Unidirectional Information Flow 
<P>Subsystem X Subsystem Y
<P>TS (C or U) C
<P>SH (TS) Subsystem Z (C) MLS (C-U)
<P>TS
<P>S
<P>C
<P>MLS (TS-C)
<P>The system high mode is usually assigned to A!S that are unevaluated or are 
NCSC evaluated in class C. These AIS do not employ explicit labels because they 
cannot be trusted to differentiate between sensitivity levels. All information 
within these AIS is implicitly labeled. When exported on a single level channel, 
by default the information is labeled implicitly by the level of the channel. 
Human-readable output must be labeled at the system high level; it may be 
manually downgraded by an authorized reviewer.
<P>Explicit labels are required on a multilevel channel. In order to export 
explicit labels, Subsystem X would normally be expected to be NCSC-evaluated at 
BI or above or employ an 1/0 device, such as those shown in Figure 6, NCSC 
evaluated at BI or above. Also, Subsystem X or the 1/0 device should be used as 
specified in Section 4 of this guideline. Lacking such NCSC evaluation, the MOA 
between the Accreditors would have to specifically address these labels.
<P>Subsystem X can import a message from Subsystem Y, but cannot acknowledge 
receipt of that message, because an exported acknowledgment (labeled TS) cannot 
be imported by Subsystem Y, which can only receive C or U information. 
Transmitting an acknowledgment from Subsystem X to Subsystem Y would constitute 
a write-down (i.e., writing information at a lower sensitivity level-generally a 
security violation.)
<P>Subsystems Y and Z can exchange information at C since this level is in the 
accreditation range of each subsystem. When only unidirectional communication 
(no acknowledgment) is utilized between two subsystems, write up is permitted if 
each sensitivity level in the source subsystem is dominated by a sensitivity 
level in the destination subsystem. The receiving subsystem must change the 
sensitivity level of the message when the message is received. For instance, U 
information sent from Subsystem Y will be labeled C by Subsystem Z.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR6.2   3 57">6.2 Interconnection Rule</A></H3>The Interconnection 
Rule states that each device in the network must be separately accredited to 
operate in an approved security mode of operation and with a specific 
accreditation range. The device is accredited to participate in the network at 
those levels and only those levels. This means that information exported at a 
given sensitivity level can be sent only to an importing device whose 
accreditation range contains that level or a higher level. Information is 
relabeled, implicitly or explicitly, upon reception at a higher level within the 
importing device accreditation range only if the original level is not in that 
range.
<P>According to the Interconnection Rule, a multilevel network may contain 
devices with different operating modes: dedicated, system high, partitioned, and 
multilevel. Also the devices may differ in the sensitivity levels and categories 
which they process, and the formal access approvals of their users (some users 
may not have access to all information).
<P>Figure 7 illustrates the flexibility of the Interconnection Rule. For 
example, the Interconnection Rule will allow, with certain restrictions, a 
multilevel subsystem to communicate with a single-level subsystem and with 
another multilevel subsystem (and the two MLS subsystems may have different 
accreditation ranges). It also allows for one-way communication to a 
higher-level system. It is intended to be a non-restricting rule and yet ensure 
that each system receives only information that it can properly mark and handle. 
Interconnection in the context of the Interconnection Rule means only direct 
connections, that is, without any intermediate accredited subsystem.
<P>The Interconnection Rule alone does not guarantee that classified information 
will not be exposed to greater risks in a network than in a stand-alone 
environment. One problem in networks that is dealt with at some length below is 
the cascading problem.
<P>Figure 8
<P>A Complex Interconnection

<P>Subsystem X Subsystem Y
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR6.2.1   4 58">6.2.1 A Complex Example</A></H4>The 
Interconnection Rule and device range allow for some rather challenging 
situations. Consider, for example, the connection depicted in Figure 8. The 
system on the left processes TS information of two types: categories A and P 
(where P is the union of categories C and D, P = C U D). The system on the right 
processes the categories C and Q (where Q is the union of categories A and B, Q 
= A U B). The two devices have no sensitivity levels in common. Yet this is a 
legitimate connection as long as only TS ,A and TS ,C information is 
transferred. Any information sent must be relabeled upon receipt. Information in 
category A is relabeled Q when received on the right, ad information in category 
C is relabeled P when received on the left
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR6.3   3 58">6.3 Risk Factors</A></H3>There are two global 
considerations that affect the interconnection of systems. The first is called 
propagation of local risk and the second is the cascading problem. Before 
discussing these considerations, the concepts of subsystem connection view and 
global network view need to be introduced.
<P>As discussed in the previous section, any subsystem that is connected to 
other subsystems must enforce the Interconnection Rule. Using the subsystem 
connection view, each subsystem responsible for maintaining the separation of 
multiple levels of information must decide locally whether or not information 
can be sent or received. This view, then, does not require a subsystem to know 
the accreditation ranges of all the subsystems on the network; only of those 
with which it can communicate without an intermediary.
<P>The Interconnection Rule applies to communication between any two (or more) 
accredited systems. However, even when the Interconnection Rule is followed, 
there may be other potential security problems that will require the 
implementation of additional constraints on the network. In order to address 
these problems, it is necessary to adopt a global view of the network. This view 
requires a knowledge of the accreditation ranges of all the subsystems in the 
network. That is, it is no longer determinable locally whether or not a 
constraint is being satisfied. These accreditation ranges are taken into account 
when determining whether or not a subsystem should be allowed to connect to the 
network. In this way, the potential damage that can occur when information is 
compromised or modified can be limited to an acceptable level.
<P>Two global concerns are discussed below. One concern is the propagation of 
local risk; the other is the cascading problem.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR6.3.1   4 59">6.3.1 Propagation of Local Risk</A></H4>The term 
Propagation of Local Risk comes from the notion of jeopardizing the security of 
a system as a result of weaknesses in other systems to which it may be 
connected. Table 3 in Section 4 recommends minimum classes of trusted systems 
for specific environments. Unfortunately, in many cases, operational needs have 
led to the accreditation of systems for multilevel operation that would not meet 
the requirements of the recommended class. While this increased risk may be 
accepted by the Accreditor of a particular system, connection of such a system 
to a network exposes users of all other subsystems in the network to the 
additional risk. Consequently, when an unevaluated system, or one that does not 
meet the class recommended for its accreditation, is proposed for connection to 
a network, constraints should be considered, such as one-way connections, manual 
review of transmissions, cryptographic isolation, or other measures to limit the 
risk it introduces.
<P>In the special case of a common user network such as DDN, it may be necessary 
to provide communications capabilities among systems that do not conform to the 
security requirements established by the network Accreditor (i.e., a system 
meeting no security requirements may be connected to a network.) One common way 
to provide network service to these non-conforming systems while still 
protecting the other, conforming, systems would be to segregate the 
non-conforming systems into closed communities that could not directly 
communicate with conforming systems. This approach is discussed in detail in the 
Defense Data Network Security Architecture [18].
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR6.3.2   4 59">6.3.2 The Cascading Problem</A></H4>One of the 
problems that the Interconnection Rule does not address is the cascading 
problem, discussed in Appendix C of the INI. The cascading problem exists when 
an attacker can take advantage of network connections to reduce the nominal 
system resistance against leaking information across a range of sensitivity 
levels. Most multilevel systems, evaluated or not, are vulnerable to some risk 
that information can be leaked from a higher to a lower level supported on the 
system. The accreditation range of a subsystem represents a judgment that the 
risk is acceptable for that range of classifications. The size of the range is 
one indication of the attractiveness of the system as a target, so larger ranges 
call for more care in system design and management. In particular, Section 4 of 
this guideline discusses computation of a risk index calculation based on the 
accreditation range, and recommends a minimum evaluation class for a given risk 
index.
<P>The cascading problem results from the observation that subsystems may be 
connected in such a way that the network covers a larger sensitivity level range 
than the individual systems are accredited to handle. Depending on the actual 
topology of the interconnection and the characteristics of the installations, 
the amount of effort required for an attacker to take advantage of residual 
vulnerabilities may be less than what is required for the network sensitivity 
range.
<P>To see how this is possible, consider two systems, each of which is 
accredited to handle two adjacent classifications of information, as shown in 
Figure 9. Subsystem A processes Secret and Top Secret information, and all users 
are cleared to at least the Secret level. Subsystem B processes Confidential and 
Secret information, and all users are cleared to at least the Confidential 
level.
<P>The network as a whole has three levels of information. However, the leakage 
resistance of the network is only that offered by two systems qualified for only 
two levels. To make Top Secret information available to Confidential users, an 
attacker might attempt to:
<P>
<OL>
  <OL>
    <LI>Install a Trojan horse in Subsystem A to leak some Top Secret 
    information to Secret<BR>
    <LI>Send that information across the network link to Subsystem B<BR>
    <LI>Install a Trojan horse in Subsystem B to leak the original Top Secret 
    information, now labeled Secret, to Confidential.<BR></LI></OL></OL>The path 
from Top Secret in Subsystem A to Confidential in Subsystem B is referred to as 
a cascading path, with three steps. Step 1 is from TS to S in Subsystem A, Step 
2 is the network link, and Step 3 is from S to C in Subsystem B. Steps (1) and 
(3), the downgrading steps, offer resistance commensurate with strictly smaller 
ranges. Step (2), the network link, offers no additional resistance, given that 
the two Trojan horses have been written and installed.
<P>Figure 9
<P>Cascading Problem
<P>Subsystem A
<P>TS Subsystem B
<P>S S
<P>C
<P>The question is, whether subverting two systems qualified for two levels of 
information is as hard as defeating one system qualified for three levels of 
information. In some cases it might be. Lee [19] gives an argument that if two 
systems have probabilistically independent flaw sources, "...the resistance to 
threat of a cascade of two B2 systems is approximately the same as, or even 
better than, that of a B3 system."
<P>
<P>But Lee also remarks that demonstrating effective independence of flaw 
sources m a practical case is not easy, and that two systems may have the same 
or equivalent flaws, particularly if their TCBs are the same, or are separate 
implementations of a single flawed design. Exploitation of the flaws on two or 
more systems does present additional resistance to the attacker, but it should 
be kept in mind that physical access to all interconnected systems is not 
necessary to send untrusted software to them, as our experience with viruses 
shows unmistakably.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.3.2.1   5 61">6.3.2.1 Tests for Cascading. </A></H5>For a 
relatively large and complex interconnection of systems, it might not be obvious 
whether a cascading problem exists. Appendix C of the TNI includes three 
approaches, with different degrees of complexity and precision, for recognizing 
a potential cascading problem. These range from a simple test that is rather 
pessimistic, called the nesting condition, to a complex procedure. Appendix A of 
this TNIEG reviews the nesting condition, and presents additional information 
concerning tests for the cascading problem.
<P>Whichever test for cascading is employed, its result is to focus attention on 
certain subsystems and their network connections that might potentially be 
subject to a cascading threat. The next step is to determine whether the systems 
involved are actually vulnerable to the multiple coordinated attack that is 
necessary for cascading, ad, if so, to consider countermeasures.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.3.2.2   5 61">6.3.2.2 Solutions.</A></H5>There are several 
ways to tackle a cascading problem. Since cascading depends on cooperative 
action by malicious software on the participating subsystems, one approach is to 
institute configuration controls to prevent installation of unscrutinized 
software, or perhaps isolating it from network usage.
<P>Another solution is to use a more trusted subsystem at appropriate nodes in 
the network, so that an attacker will be forced to overcome a protection 
mechanism commensurate with the seriousness of the potential compromise. In 
Figure 9, for example, if either subsystem A or subsystem B is NCSC-evaluated at 
class B3, which is sufficient according to Table 3 in Section 4 of this 
guideline for a range of Top Secret to Confidential, then the attacker is 
presented with an acceptable level of difficulty.
<P>A cascading threat can also be interdicted by eliminating certain network 
connections, to break paths by which an attacker could compromise information 
with insufficient resistance. This solution is practical only when the links to 
be eliminated are not needed for operational reasons. Sometimes end-to-end 
encryption can be used to address a cascading threat while preserving necessary 
connectivity, by reducing the level of information available to intermediate 
systems on a communication path.
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR 2 62">APPENDIX A: Tests for the Cascading Problem</A></H2>The 
cascading problem was discussed in Section 6. This appendix reviews the 
approaches presented in Appendix C of the TN! for testing whether a cascading 
problem exists in an interconnection of accredited subsystems. Three criteria 
are given there: the nesting condition, the cascade condition, and a heuristic 
procedure. The nesting condition is a simple but pessimistic test that can, in 
some cases, dismiss the possibility of a cascading problem. When it fails, there 
is not necessarily a cascading problem; other, more accurate, tests should then 
be applied to confirm and locate it. This appendix first summarizes the nesting 
condition, and then discusses other approaches briefly. A forthcoming report 
will provide further guidance on computational approaches for the cascading 
problem.
<P>A.l Nesting Condition
<P>The nesting condition is evaluated solely on the basis of the accreditation 
ranges of the subsystems. In the form given both here and in the TNI, it is 
applicable only when all sensitivity levels are totally ordered - that is, if 
they can be placed in order such that each one is higher than the one before it. 
This is true, in particular, if they are pure classifications, with no 
categories or compartments.
<P>The nesting condition is satisfied, by definition, if the accreditation 
ranges of each pair of subsystems are either disjoint or nested. A pair of 
accreditation ranges is disjoint if they have no levels in common. They are 
nested if one range is included (as a subset) in the other. All possible pairs 
(not just those of adjacent subsystems) must be considered, but some pairs may 
be nested while others are disjoint.
<P>If the nesting condition is satisfied, there is no cascading problem. Because 
the nesting condition does not take into account which network subsystems are 
actually connected to one another, it can sometimes give a pessimistic result, 
i.e., there are cases when the nesting condition fails, but there is actually no 
cascading problem.

<P>Example 1: Consider the situation illustrated in Figure A-I. The 
accreditation range of Subsystem X is nested within that of Subsystem Y (i.e., 
C-S is completely contained within C-TS). Therefore, the nesting condition is 
satisfied, and there is no cascading problem.

<P>Example 2: Consider the situation illustrated in Figure A-2. The 
accreditation ranges of Subsystem A and Subsystem B are not disjoint; neither is 
one completely contained within the other. Therefore, the nesting condition 
fails, ad a cascading problem is possible. Note, however, that the nesting 
condition would still fail even if the two subsystems were not connected to one 
another, yet in that case there would be, no cascading problem.
<P>The situation is more complex when sensitivity levels are drawn from a 
partially ordered set, so that the accreditation ranges of some subsystems have 
sensitivity levels that are incomparable. Two sensitivity levels are 
incomparable when neither is greater than or equal to the other. Sensitivity 
levels with category sets are, in general, incomparable. An extended form of the 
nesting condition has been devised that applies to partially ordered sensitivity 
level sets. [20]
<P>A.2 Other Approaches
<P>Appendix C of the TNI contains two other criteria for the cascading problem: 
the cascade condition, which is a mathematical characterization of the problem, 
and a heuristic procedure. These criteria have been superseded by improved 
methods since the publication of the TNI. The new approach is described in a 
separate report, in order to give adequate scope to the presentation of 
background and context necessary to apply it appropriately.
<P>The need for a new approach arose from a recognition of the limitations of 
the existing criteria. The cascade condition is accurate but it is not, in 
itself, a computational procedure. It is limited by its assumption that all of 
the interconnected subsystems have been given evaluation classes. The heuristic 
procedure is believed to provide a conservative approximate test for cascading, 
but only when applied to interconnections in which all communication paths are 
two-way, i.e., capable of both sending and receiving. A simpler procedure is now 
available.
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR 2 64">APPENDIX B: Background References</A></H2>Neither the TNI

<H2><A name="HDR 2 66">APPENDIX C: Encryption</A></H2>May networks today use or 
plan to use encryption as a fundamental mechanism for providing security 
services. The encryption devices provide a security perimeter at the protocol 
layer at which they provide service (typically the Network or Transport Layer). 
This section presents some information on how an encryption system can be part 
of the NSAD. It discusses MAC and DAC, use of encryption to reduce the number of 
AIS, and the risk index of the encryption system.
<P>C.1 Use of Encryption
<P>As indicated in the TN!, an encryption mechanism is evaluated differently 
than other mechanisms. Evaluating encryption mechanisms has a long history 
predating the TNI. Evaluation of an encryption mechanism is part of COMSEC. 
Generally, encryption mechanisms receive a rating of the highest level of 
classified information which may be protected using that mechanism. Therefore, 
the only rating applicable to an encryption mechanism is the classification 
level of the information that is to be protected. This classification level also 
establishes the requirement. 
<P>In general, organizations using the TNI and this document select their 
encryption mechanisms from a list provided by an organization which is 
responsible for evaluating such mechanisms. In many cases, that organization is 
the NSA.
<P>A more complicated situation exists when encryption is employed above the 
Link Protocol Layer, layer 2. At layers 3 and 4 the protocols are concerned with 
the end systems or intermediate devices (e.g., hosts, network switches) that the 
links connect. Higher layers are concerned with other peer entities. 
Traditionally, encryption applied above layer 2 has been termed end-to-end 
encryption, or E3.
<P>An E3 system may be provided as (part of) an NTCB. When the E3 system is 
integral to the NTCB, the use of the E3 system requires evaluation under the 
TCSEC with interpretations in the TNI. The evaluation must consider (1) the 
accreditation rage of the user interface, (2) the risk index for the bypass in 
the E3 device, and (3) the risk index between the highest sensitivity data ad 
the lowest clearance of user on the network.
<P>Depending on the design, devices of an E3system may satisfy all requirements 
for a system evaluated under Part! of the TN!. MAC may be provided either 
explicitly or implicitly. Explicit MAC is provided if the packets sent by the 
encryption device include a security label. Implicit MAC is provided if the 
security level must be inferred from the encryption key used to protect the 
data. All data protected by that key must be classified at a single security 
level.
<P>DAC is often provided in an E3 system as well. Typically, keys for exchanging 
data are provided to the E3 devices only after DAC has been applied. The 
encryption devices can provide identification ad authentication. While 
identification is generally done explicitly (by transmitting an identifier), 
authentication can be done implicitly (i.e., by the use of a unique key). The 
encryption devices may perform certain types of auditing as well. Typically, a 
device collects information and forwards it to another device for storage. 
Information collected may include: connections established, connections refused, 
packets with inappropriate labels, and misrouted packets. The granularity 
provided by these E3 mechanisms is determined by the protocol layer at which the 
service is offered.
<P>Figure C-1
<P>Typical Interconnected AIS
<P>Host LAN Gateway WAN Gateway LAN Host 
<P>AIS 1 AIS 2 AIS 3 AIS 4 AIS 5 AIS 6 AIS 7
<P>In a typical network there will be a number of A!S. For example, two hosts 
are often attached to separate local networks connected by a wide area network 
(WAN). As shown in Figure C-1, the path between the hosts (without E3) may 
involve 7 separate interconnected AIS.
<P>E<EM sup>3 can help reduce the number of A!S. By placing E3 devices between 
each host and the LAN to which it is connected ad incorporating suitable key 
distribution components, the LANs and WAN collapse into a single network system 
and the path now traverses only three AIS, as shown in Figure C-2. A!S 2 
provides security services to the hosts, therefore, it may be part of the 
NTCB.</EM>
<P>Figure C-2
<P>Using End-to-End Encryption to Reduce Number of AIS
<P>Host E<EM sup>3 LAN Gateway WAN Gateway LAN E3 Host </EM>
<P>AIS 1 AIS 2 AIS 3 
<P>There may be a hierarchy of trusted system views. For example, E3 may be 
provided at protocol layers 3,4, and 7. Depending on the architecture, the 
layers of E3 could constitute a single NTCB or each could be a separate NTCB. In 
the latter case, the devices supporting different layers would be part of 
different AIS and the interconnection rules would be applied between higher and 
lower protocol layers.
<P>In general, an A!S at a higher protocol layer encompasses more devices than 
one at a lower protocol layer. The granularity of services offered is also finer 
at the higher protocol layer.
<P>In a situation where the higher protocol layer encryption system also has a 
higher evaluation class, the lower protocol layers might be considered less 
trusted just as current E3 designs treat the subnetwork as untrusted. Continuing 
the analogy, just as certain physical security requirements are imposed on the 
untrusted subnetwork, the higher protocol layer encryption might rely on 
characteristics of the lower protocol layers.
<P>However, one may be faced with a dilemma that the higher protocol layer E<EM 
sup>3 system has a lower security evaluation than the lower-protocol-layer 
trusted system. For example, a WAN with E3 at layer 3 might be evaluated Al. The 
system might also provide E3 at layer 4, but an NTCB that includes layer 4 
might. only be rated B2. In this case, treating the subsystems constituting the 
separate layers as separate AIS and using the Interconnection Rule to accredit 
the network as a whole could prove advantageous, as illustrated in Figure 
C-3.</EM>

<P>In a trusted AIS, the recommended evaluation class is determined using a risk 
index based on the highest data classification and the lowest user clearance. In 
considering an E3 subsystem in a network, three separate indexes must be 
considered [21]:
<P>
<OL>
  <LI><B>The subscriber's range of sensitivity levels. The clear text side of 
  the encryption subsystem must be sufficiently trusted to maintain separation 
  among the clear text data streams sent and received by the subscriber attached 
  to the encryption subsystem. A risk index is based on the highest and lowest 
  sensitivity levels sent or received by the subscriber through this encryption 
  subsystem.</B><BR>
  <LI><B>The bypass. In an E3 system, protocol control information must be sent 
  around the encryption unit through a bypass. The software and hardware to 
  implement the bypass must be trusted not to send user data through the bypass. 
  A risk index can be computed based on the difference between the sensitivity 
  level of the clear text information and the sensitivity level of the untrusted 
  subsystems of the network.</B><BR>
  <LI><B>The range of sensitivity levels across the network. This risk index is 
  concerned with the difference between the highest level of information any 
  host attached to the network and the lowest clearance of a user that could 
  potentially get access to that information. Depending on the characteristics 
  of the network, this risk index could be larger than either 1. or 2. above. 
  The worst case scenario occurs when some users have lower clearances than the 
  level at which the network backbone is physically protected. For example, 
  there are currently plans to allow some uncleared users on the DISNET segment 
  of the DDN [22] which will be physically protected at the Secret level. In 
  that case, the risk index for the bypass works the opposite of the normal 
  case: the ciphertext side will be the higher of the two 
ratings.</B><BR></LI></OL>The subsystem which performs access control and key 
distribution must also be concerned with this risk range since improper key 
distribution could lead to compromise across the entire network. An erroneous 
distribution could potentially permit the lowest cleared user to access the 
highest classification of information.
