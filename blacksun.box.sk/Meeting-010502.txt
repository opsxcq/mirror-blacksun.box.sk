<dataholic> Mikkkeee is on voice spree :)
<SpiderMan> ok, so about the design
<Mikkkeee> okay bsrf needs to start publishing more interesting / advanced tuts because the stuff being released is still n00b/intermediate
<Mind_Booster> IMHO the 2001 "sald" may be considered positive, although lot more could been done if there was activity on every member... being on the IRC channel sometimes is not my view of an "active" member!
<eightball> mikkkeee: Can i make a point:
*** MackaDelic has quit IRC (Quit: CyA PEoPLe iN ThE UnDeRGrOuND)
<zwanderer> Mikkkeee: I am translating a number of RSA Math theory/Implementation tuts from my native -> English... you can have those too... we talked about that
<Mikkkeee> okay cool
<Mikkkeee> we haven't had any translations lately
<eightball> I Do not want to join as a MEMBER but i am willing to write tutorials on security,to electronical computer science.
<eightball> asap
<Dead_Beat> Mikkkeee I could trans to german...
<Mind_Booster> I agree on that Mikkkeee: the only material released by bsrf is very newbie stuff, and, as oyu can see if you try to notice there's a lot of laming here caused on where is gr, mano, paya , ralph, forbze
<killerbeez> I could do Arabic! ;>
<Mind_Booster> fuck
<Mikkkeee> also as everyone knows bsrf will be contributing largely to the black ezine due some time from now
<dataholic> I could do leet0!
<Mind_Booster> I messed up with paste :-P
<eightball> i could do afganistani:) 
<AZTEK> yes
*** Mikkkeee sets mode: +v Dunceor
<Mikkkeee> okay enough joking
<Mind_Booster> I was saying lamig here caused by misinformation
<Mikkkeee> we need any sort of translations
<Mikkkeee> and contributions
<zwanderer> Mikkkeee: and hopefully in future issues aswell
<Dunceor> true i think BSRF should get more translate
<Dunceor> but i don't agree on the newbie level
<Dunceor> there are both adanvced and newbie tut's on bsrf
<Dunceor> and it should be both
<Dead_Beat> hmm advanced?...
<Mikkkeee> lkm lecture is the most
<Mind_Booster> working only on the "newbie level" makes ppl who "pass" that stage to get misinformated...
<killerbeez> I haven't seen many sites publishing advanced tuts, and info, everything seems to be for newbies!!
<eightball> MEMBERS: I am willing to write lots of new tutorials on a diverse range of topics:- My current college diploma is on electronical computer tech
<AZTEK> we need to stop writing newbue related tutorials and start writing tutorials that could actually be useful
<rek> Mikkkeee: i got a lecture done by i01 for bsrf, i'll send it in now
<Mikkkeee> shaddy okay once you write anything send it over
<Dunceor> well it takes alot of knowledge to write a tut good
<Mikkkeee> rek whats the topic
<Dunceor> then u really need to know what u talk about
<rek> customizing packets
<rek> in c
<Mikkkeee> k
<AZTEK> ok guys not
<Mikkkeee> when was it dine
<AZTEK> *now
<AZTEK> order order
<Dunceor> so if u think it's on a easy level, write tut's, i think u learn alot from that
<rek> a week ago i would say
<rek> in here
<Mikkkeee> k
<Mikkkeee> AZTEK sup
<AZTEK> we need to go thorugh and have each memner tell what they are working on right now
<eightball> I would suggest an Idea also for the tuts page: Why not have a seach box: i got the code for it
<AZTEK> *member
<SpiderMan> yeah

<killerbeez> A suggestion: you can have an open-source development section, where programs are qritten, which ppl can learn from....
<AZTEK> that's an idea we have been tossing around
<Mikkkeee> spider also say about that admin program your working on
<Mikkkeee> yah also we'll mention contests
<DigitalFallout> heh
<SpiderMan> I will when it's my turn :)
<AZTEK> mike are you refering to scram?

<AZTEK> its a must read for php monkeys
<ph> i got an online book :D
<SpiderMan> next
<SpiderMan> sorry, I have a lot to say
<Mikkkeee> k
<AZTEK> that's cool dude
<rek> <AZTEK> questions?
<AZTEK> not yet
<rek> :)
<rek> ah
<SpiderMan> I was talking to Mano, we want to see something done about making the site more accessible
<rek> damnit, i'm always early
<SpiderMan> mostly to the blind
<SpiderMan> it may sound dumb
<SpiderMan> but I think it's needed
<SpiderMan> I'm willing to work on that
<AZTEK> like a text reader
<SpiderMan> and get it done over the course of a month
*** HaloScan has joined #bsrf
<ph> Can i work on something? i know php and mysql.. and linux
<AZTEK> make our site better with lynx
<SpiderMan> yeah
<ph> Cool
<SpiderMan> so when the new design comes in if that's something you guys want to do
<ph> Thats my job?
<SpiderMan> pass it on to me
<AZTEK> which its not that badd currently
<SpiderMan> and I'll take care of it
<tokeweed> A text only version
<tokeweed> ?
<AZTEK> ph: no
<ph> dam ;(
<AZTEK> ph: we will get something for you
<SpiderMan> also, I'd like to see an XML backend put in for our news
<SpiderMan> so other sites can syndicate it
<AZTEK> SpiderMan: we know
<SpiderMan> such as Rattlesnake's news thing
<SpiderMan> heh ok
<tokeweed> Yeah ph you will slave in the underground sweatshop of bsrf.
<SpiderMan> I'm willing to work on that also
<SpiderMan> get it done in about a week
<suspect> lol
<ph> lol i want to be a cool memeber
<AZTEK> SpiderMan: it migth happen if cube gives us a mysql database
<ph> without any one knowing
<rek> ph: that's me :)
<SpiderMan> yeah I was hoping we could get something
<ph> rek yep
<SpiderMan> about the open source thing
<Mikkkeee> i think cube might let us use the edge engine
<AZTEK> I could talk to him later sometime
<SpiderMan> maybe we should do a cross over of that with a place like code.box.sk
<Mind_Booster> One issue... I think bsrf should try to have more independence... relating box networks. One thing to do, IMHO, is to "leave" the IRC channel idea, substituting that for a much better sollution: a BlackSun Talker. I can help on that...
<AZTEK> just the message board
<AZTEK> we want to keep the individualaty
<AZTEK> I could work on that
*** Zerolimit has left #bsrf
<AZTEK> if cube says ok I can get us the source asap
<SpiderMan> hm...it's not so bad being closely tied with box
<AZTEK> I have access now
<killerbeez> Another suggestion: you guys could have a section for open-wingates (like cyberarmys which is down at the mo), where ppl can post "reliable wingate ip's", which are bloody hard to come accross these days!!!
<Mikkkeee> hehe
<Dunceor> yeah wingates are hard to come by
<Mikkkeee> i guess we will have to do the posting
*** Royaljam has quit IRC (Quit: I hope life isn't a joke cuz i dont get it)
<AZTEK> killerbeez that didn't go over to well for ca
<Mikkkeee> well we have a shells list and no one has helped post nay
<SpiderMan> and lastly this is what Mano wanted to say
<Mikkkeee> any
<ph> AZTEK, why dont you leech the code for my online book make ur brsf more dynamic
<AZTEK> ph: perhaps
<Mikkkeee> too much dynamic is bad
<ph> And every month a new thing
*** stooboy has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
<Mikkkeee> not compatible with cross browsers
<AZTEK> yea
<SpiderMan> I can make it compatible
<Mikkkeee> also we got to change bsrf to look good on linux / nutscape browsers
<AZTEK> ok
<SpiderMan> we just need to move away from a lot of old HTML
<Mikkkeee> hell yah
<SpiderMan> XHTML and CSS will accomplish that
<Mikkkeee> xml is the plan
<ph> a search in the tut section!!
<AZTEK> also in that open source section I will be posting a buch of functions and useful thing I have written

<b0n3n0S3> can I have +o ?
<AZTEK> killerbeez: not a trojan
<AZTEK> not a trojan
<AZTEK> it is a admin tool
<rek> b0n3n0S3: you can have +b
<DigitalFallout> killerbeez: this isnt really a trojan, it is a legit adminisration tool
<killerbeez> then what?
<SpiderMan> and not like b0
<SpiderMan> there is nothing like controlling the mouse
<AZTEK> in thoery it could be a trojan but that's not its purpose
<SpiderMan> and crap like that

*** anNA-maRIa64 has joined #bsrf
<Ph03nix> how u gonna release scram? download off BSRF?
<AZTEK> yea its like linuxconf only better and remote
<killerbeez> Oh so, its a trojan, with a "Remote Administration tool", as the name...??
*** MaD_MaX has joined #bsrf
<SpiderMan> noo
<SpiderMan> not a trojan at all
<SpiderMan> it doesn't hide
<DigitalFallout> killerbeez: No, it is REALLY a remote admin tool
<SpiderMan> it doesn't open the cd tray
<AZTEK> seriously
<killerbeez> lol
<AZTEK> its to help the admin
<SpiderMan> it doesn't steal passwords
<datawize> i want to join in on this project
<killerbeez> so, why you guys writtin it?
<datawize> can i plz
<AZTEK> if hear it referd to as a trojan I am going to kick some ass
<Ph03nix> lol
<DigitalFallout> Most of us admin UNIX servers and we figure alot of guys can get some help from it
<MANOWAR^> killerbeez: do you know what Webmin is?
<AZTEK> datawize: perhaps
<datawize> eheh
<MANOWAR^> by what i read they want to do something like that with the web interface....
<MANOWAR^> maybe i am wrong
<rek> it's gonna be secure so only the admin can use it on his computers
<datawize> i want in on the ircd project too
<AZTEK> the ircd project is box not us
<killerbeez> Rek: so, whats the point of it?
<Mind_Booster> one question: do the "bootm0n" (I think this is the name :-P) is still a bsrf project?
<AZTEK> talk to a box.sk team member
<datawize> how long do we have to wait for the code "ircd"
<SpiderMan> bootm0n was back in the day
<Floyd_> '
<killerbeez> There are programs like bo2k, PcAnywhere that can do the same thing, why do we need another one?
<Mikkkeee> boot mon is dead
<AZTEK> killerbeez: realy
<Mikkkeee> the program is still hosted
<DigitalFallout> We arent afiliated really with any of the other projects, we are just somplace in the .box.sk nexus
<DigitalFallout> :)
<AZTEK> I have never seen pcanywhere for unix
<rek> killerbeez: say your the boss and you need to grab a fiel from your co-worker's computer who's 3 miles away, log into his comptuer and grab it (it's secure so only the password holder can login and shit)

<Mikkkeee> mano means like a digitalized tutorial
<MANOWAR^> SpiderMan said that people with disability problems
<Mikkkeee> like  a movie showing you what to do
<AZTEK> why not just send it throgh a text 2 speech program
<Mikkkeee> for complicated topics
<MANOWAR^> have been e-mailing him
<MANOWAR^> AZTEK: to be original?
<Mikkkeee> mano the tut is updated

*** Ph03nix has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
<Mikkkeee> okay so
<Mikkkeee> this is what we got to agree on
<Mikkkeee> a new tutorials page is needed
-Dead_Beat- btw what about the tutorials I submitted
<Mikkkeee> at least one lecture/tut by each member
*** data has joined #bsrf
<Mikkkeee> every few months
<DigitalFallout> Mikkkeee: the froboze beta...
<MANOWAR^> AZTEK: the benefits from it is 
<AZTEK> yea df is right we need to make some final decissions tonight
*** datawize has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<Mikkkeee> tuts got to be by bsrf members
<rek> member's check blah on what i just said
<Mikkkeee> if we keep accepting non member tuts we would be an archive site
<AZTEK> I like forbze idea for the new tuts page
<SpiderMan> what was frobze idea?
*** data is now known as _data-
<AZTEK> yea
<Mikkkeee> well its taking him 3 + months to finish
<DigitalFallout> Let me find the link
<AZTEK> now seriously we have some inactive members
<AZTEK> we need to discuss some of the finer points
<Mikkkeee> okay 
<MANOWAR^> some log
<MANOWAR^> what you are saying
<Mikkkeee> forbze/ralph/guy/mano need to release something
<MANOWAR^> while i go set up the shell
<Mikkkeee> quick
<SpiderMan> Mano: I am
<AZTEK> the message board should shift back to being a major memebr thing
<rek> i'll give @least 5 minutes a day towards it
<Mikkkeee> all we ask is each member visit it 5 minutes a day
<Mikkkeee> nothing big but will help as hell
<AZTEK> yes
<SpiderMan> I give a lot of time, but most it is spent waiting for the board to load
<AZTEK> writing a byteme every month is not a bad idea
<rek> haha
<MANOWAR^> Mikkkeee: i am at the forum at least 10 times a day
<Mikkkeee> mano i know
<Mikkkeee> but other members
<SpiderMan> that's why I think mano should get message board admin
<Mikkkeee> who never show up
<AZTEK> yea
<Mikkkeee> okay done
<AZTEK> well will talk later in blah
<Mikkkeee> mano your the admin
<rek> i never show up
<rek> but i will

*** ShutD0wN has quit IRC (Remote closed the connection)
<AZTEK> ok
<Mikkkeee> mind booster did you see the new design
<SpiderMan> I figure we should voice a person at a time and let them get their input in
<AZTEK> :\
<SpiderMan> so it doesn't get out of hand
<Dunceor> i think as long as the non -member tut's are good and says "written for BSRF" i think they should be accepted
<Mikkkeee>  http://blacksun.box.sk/pictures/newdesign.gif
<AZTEK> that's a lot of time
<SpiderMan> I'm willing to stay til about 5
<Mind_Booster> I think that non-members tuts have their place in bsrf too
<Mikkkeee> dunceor thats not the point of bsrf
<SpiderMan> it's 3:55 right now
<Mikkkeee> we write our own tuts
<SpiderMan> I think they should all get a turn
<Dunceor> true
<Mikkkeee> but accept contribs
<Dunceor> but u also provide info
<Dustin> perhaps have a members tut section then a user submitted section
<Dustin> thats a fair compromise
*** Big_Al has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<Dunceor> yeah that is a good idea
<DigitalFallout> It's commin up on 7 here, i am startin to think dinner
<Dunceor> a section written bu bsrf members, a non-member section
* Mind_Booster agrees with Dustin
<Dustin> have a disclaimer if u will in the contrib section
*** MaD_MaX has quit IRC (Quit: )
<rek> since bsrf started i've heard people fighting to submet shit on bsrf and very few people auctually do

<Mikkkeee> lol

<jlp107> ok well maybe if you had like a few diff boards
*** Vegas has joined #bsrf
<jlp107> like one of you is probably kick ass at linux
<jlp107> so have a linux board
*** anNA-maRIa64 has joined #bsrf
<rek> jlp107: i'm the vb guy :)
<jlp107> ok rek
<killerbeez> What do you guys think about the wingate idea then??
<rek> jlp107: if we had multiboards, think of how long it would take to check them all
<Mikkkeee> nice idea
<jlp107> also i think you need to group the tutorials
*** anNA-maRIa64 has quit IRC (Not enough time connected)
<Mikkkeee> but who will contribute
*** anNA-maRIa64 has joined #bsrf
<killerbeez> to what?
<jlp107> well im not talented enough to contribute tutorials
<rek> as i find wingates i'll post, i got 1 i found today
*** i01 has left #bsrf
<Mikkkeee> gates man
<Dead_Beat> wingates of course killerbeez
<Mikkkeee> its not like i got 1000 gates to post
<jlp107> im just thinking maybe a newbie one
<jlp107> section rather
<Mikkkeee> your lucky if you got 5
<Mikkkeee> working 
<jlp107> and an advanced section
<jlp107> kinda like a step by step for a new user
<rek> and they go up and down
<killerbeez> oh well everyone, like cyberarmys, but more reliable ones!
<b0n3n0S3> rek: where is the +o , asked you about it an hour ago
*** Dunceor has quit IRC (Quit: )
<rek> so it's be like hard to keep real one's up
<jlp107> rek
*** anNA-maRIa64 is now known as _anNA-maRIa64-
<rek> b0n3n0S3: and i said i'll give you +b if you want it
<Dead_Beat> lol b0n3n0S3 ;)>
<jlp107> if the boards content was kept relevent to the topic
<jlp107> it would be easy to moderate
*** Stephan has joined #bsrf
*** Guilt has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
<killerbeez> well, what do-ya-think?
<killerbeez> They've taken cyberarmys down...
<rek> the board loads very slowely, 10 different board, it'd take 5 minutes to load them all
<jlp107> load one at a time
*** _anNA-maRIa64- is now known as anNA-maRIa64
<Mikkkeee> i think a good idea is to make an old team member list
<rek> that's what i'm saying
<jlp107> let the user pick which board he wants
<jlp107> and go use it
<Mikkkeee> cause everyone claims they are a member if the guys know what i mean
<Dustin> phpBB
<Dustin> has a feature like that
<Mikkkeee> ;)
<jlp107> i mean im sure someone wanting a solution for an nt prob doesn't want to read every linux problem
<jlp107> and vice versa
<SpiderMan> ok ok let's keep in  mind
*** anNA-maRIa64 has quit IRC (Quit: )
<SpiderMan> that we don't have a database
<SpiderMan> and are limited on the scripts we can use
<Dustin> oh so it has to have a text backend?
*** anNA-maRIa64 has joined #bsrf
<SpiderMan> the programmers will try to work something out on the current script we have
<jlp107> does anyone on the team know php well?
<SpiderMan> Dustin: it sounds like a good idea but the board gets too many hits
<jlp107> because if so i think you could make a smaller version of the current board
<Mikkkeee> yah we are going to have to make a new board
<Dustin> your kidding, to many hits for mysql?
<SpiderMan> jlp: Cyber, AZ, and myself, we're all very good at it
<Mikkkeee> cube is giving us a new one
<jlp107> and just have board 1: linux , board 2: windows etc
<SpiderMan> Dustin: too many hits for a flat file database
<Dustin> oh, ok
*** anNA-maRIa64 has quit IRC (Not enough time connected)
<rek> if anna comes back in here she's gettin the boot
*** anNA-maRIa64 has joined #bsrf
<SpiderMan> Dustin: a flat file takes up a lot of resources and I don't think we have that much
<rek> i've counted 20 joins and leaves
<SpiderMan> I agree

<Dead_Beat> hmm
<madkiller69> about what?
<Mikkkeee> like who wants to lecture here since everyone wanted to contribut something
<Dead_Beat> I have tutorials for you Mikkkeee you know that and you have them ;)>
<jlp107> have you guys considered expanind the member team
<Sneak> lol
<madkiller69> lol
<Mikkkeee> nope
<Mikkkeee> too much members is bad
<jlp107> that way if 3 go on vacation or something it won't make such an impact
<rek> to many people idle
<Mikkkeee> we had plenty and many didn't do anything
<jlp107> well true but if you had strict rules
*** Norton has joined #bsrf
<SpiderMan> yeah
<DigitalFallout> yea
<Mind_Booster> I can contribute with a lecture...
<SpiderMan> we did get rid of a lot
<jlp107> like i mean everyone can have a vacation
<Mind_Booster> And with some tuts :-P
<Mikkkeee> deadbeat we got topics on those tuts already
<jlp107> but not just leave for 6 months and expect to come back
<killerbeez> I also think that there should be longer tuts, and ones with more quality like this PDF: http://packetstorm.widexs.nl/papers/general/hackingguide3.1.pdf
<Mikkkeee> heh
<jlp107> and i think these rules would have to be stuck by
<DigitalFallout> I am gonna go get some food
<Mikkkeee> lol
<Mikkkeee> thats a book man
<jlp107> so no matter who broke the rules
<Mind_Booster> but they can't be exclusively for blacksun: they must be to Mind Booster Networks too
<Mikkkeee> 88 pages
<jlp107> they have to leave
<Mikkkeee> and we can't write about hacking anymore
<Dead_Beat> I dunno Mikkkeee I think is BIG additions since mine include many more tricks and tipps and are well.... you know
<killerbeez> lol: but its really good
<jlp107> also a weekly meeting between the teeam members miught be good to keep everyone active
<Mikkkeee> those are included in the one we have but we need to rewrite it
<Mind_Booster> <@ Mikkkeee >and we can't write about hacking anymore 0,1 <- Why is that?
<Dustin> if you have topics for them to talk about..
<Mikkkeee> new usa law
<rek> Mind_Booster: new law
<SpiderMan> jlp: we meet up a lot anyway
<DigitalFallout> jlp107: we tried that also but nobdy ever shows p
<jlp107> if someone can't be bothered to show up for a meeting then it says alot about their dedication
<rek> we can life in jail in the usa for helping people hack
<Mind_Booster> oh yeah...
<rek> we can get life in jail in the usa for helping people hack
<DigitalFallout> heh
<SpiderMan> it doesn't really matter, we all talk to each other at least once a week
<killerbeez> So, what is bsrf going to write about then, Gardening???
<Dead_Beat> Mikkkeee privmsg
*** Phaedrus has joined #bsrf
<Mikkkeee> one thing we got to consider si that we got ppl in australia, and europe 
<MANOWAR^> Mikkkeee: technicaly
<Norton> u cant even write about hacking?
<MANOWAR^> the law
<Mikkkeee> so they can't stay up late
<MANOWAR^> doesn't apply to us
<DigitalFallout> killerbeez: we are takin a more sysadmin perspective
<Mind_Booster> well... If it'as an idea of anyone here to put bsrf "helping hack" then I think they should leave.
<MANOWAR^> if our server is not located in the USA
*** SpiderMan sets mode: +m
<Mind_Booster> But talking on hacking is not forbidden
<SpiderMan> ok let's just take a minute, devoice everyone and explain this new law thing
